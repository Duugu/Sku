      <h2>Important</h2>
      <p>      
      This guide is in a beta test stage. It has been tested. But there are many things that could cause problems - from missing video drivers to unsupported screen resolutions. If you experience any problems, please contact us via Discord. We will try to support you. Please find the link in the "Important link" section on this page.
      </p>
      <p>
        For Mac users: This tutorial is for Windows users. If you are using a Mac, you can follow the instructions including the section "Installing addons and script". Everything beyond that point won't work on Mac, as the required tool Autohotkey isn't available for that plattform. You'll have to complete the remaining steps with sighted help or OCR and screen readers instead.

      <h2>What to expect</h2>      
      <p>
      This guide will enable a blind person to set up and play World of Warcraft Classic: Burning Crusade (WoW TBC) autonomously. We've developed an ingame addon called Sku for that.
      </p>
      <p>
      Setting everything up should require 30 minutes to 1 hour (depending on your internet connection, machine, etc.). Upon completing all the steps in this guide, you'll be in the game and ready to go. There's no sighted help required. But it might be helpful or speed up the process.

      <h2>What we expect</h2>
      <p>
      Keep in mind that the Sku addon was build with a lot of effort from awesome people. Up to this point, developers, route creators and test players have spent 12 months to bring World of Warcraft to blind players. It will take several more months to finish the project.
      </p>
      <p>
      We are happy to hear your feedback. If you would like to test the game and report bugs or problems, you are welcome to do so. However, please do not expect all content to be available. Some specific parts of the game, like PvP, will most likely not be available to you.
      </p>
      <p>
      Please try to provide an adequate feedback. We are really looking forward to active contributions!

      <h2>Installation and setup</h2>
      <p>
         To play WoW TBC as a blind person, the following steps are required. They are detailed in the next sections:
      </p>
      <ul>
         <li><p>Create a Battlenet account</p></li>
         <li><p>Sign up for a WoW subscription</p></li>
         <li><p>Download and install WoW</p></li>
         <li><p>Install addons and script</p></li>
         <li><p>Select a realms and create a character</p></li>
         <li><p>Configure the game</p></li>
         <li><p>Play</p></li>
      </ul>            

      <h3>Create a Battlenet account</h3>
      <p>
      Battlenet is a general service provided by Blizzard (the developer of WoW). It is required to play WoW. Thus, you need to create a free Battlenet account. Proceed as follows:
      </p>
      <ul>
         <li><p>
            Open the account creation page:<br>
            <a href="https://account.battle.net/creation/flow/creation-full">https://account.battle.net/creation/flow/creation-full</a>
          </p></li>
         <li><p>
            Follow the steps on that page to create an account.<br>
            Tip: The site may check if you are a bot. You need to solve a puzzle or something like that. There is an audio version for that challenge. Look for a "Use an audio challenge" button.
         </p></li>
          <li><p>
              After creating an account you need to verify your email address. They've sent you an email. That step is optional.
         <li><p>
            After account creation you are automatically logged in to Battlenet and redirected to the "ACCOUNT OVERVIEW" page, showing your profile.<br>
            (<a href="https://account.battle.net/overview">https://account.battle.net/overview</a>)
         </p></li>
      </ul>
        
      <h3>Subscribe to WoW</h3>
      <p>
         Now, on that page (<a href="https://account.battle.net/overview">https://account.battle.net/overview</a>) you need to sign up for a subscription to the game. This is how it works:
      </p>
      <ul>
         <li><p>
            There is a menu on the left. Select "GAMES & SUBSCRIPTIONS" or navigate to the following URL:<br>
            <a href="https://account.battle.net/games">https://account.battle.net/games</a>
         </p></li>
         <li><p>
            First of all, you need a WoW account. That is not the same as the Battlenet account you've created earlier. The Battlenet account is for all Blizzard games and services. The WoW account is for WoW only. Select "CREATE STARTER ACCOUNT".
         </p></li>
         <li><p>
            Select "Europe" or "Americas & Oceania" for the region. The region depends on where you are located. Be aware that you can't change that region later on. You are bound to that region. The regions are fully separated. You can't play on EU realms if your subscription is for the "Americas & Oceania" region and vice versa. The appropiate region for you location should be selected by default.
         </p></li>
         <li><p>
            Once you've selected the region, click on "Create account".
         </p></li>
         <li><p>
            At the top of the page you will find a new section named "GAME ACCOUNTS" with a section labeled "World of Warcraft (WoW1)", "Europe" or "Americas & Oceania" (depending on your region), "Starter Edition". Select "ADD SUBSCRIPTION" to the right of that section.
         </p></li>
         <li><p>
            Select "Continue" to agree to the privacy policy.
         </p></li>
         <li><p>
            You are automatically redirected to a page showing the available subscriptions. There are "1 month - $12.99 / month" and 3 or 6 months. If you choose 3 or 6 months, you will prepay for 3 or 6 month and save a total of three or six dollars. If you would like to give WoW a try, you probably want to choose "1 month - $12.99 / month". That subscription can be cancelled on a monthly basis.<br>
            It seems to be challenging to find the correct option using a screen reader. Therefore, you may need sighted assistance for that step. But it definitely is doable without help.<br>
            Tip: If you are using NVDA, switch to focus mode by selecting NVDA + SPACEBAR. That way the list with subscriptions and the "Buy" button should be accessible using the TAB key.
         </p></li>
         <li><p>
            After you have selected "1 month - $12.99 / month", select "Subscribe now", enter your payment details, and follow the remaining steps of the subscription process.
         </p></li>
      </ul>
         
      <h3>Download and install WoW</h3>
         <p>Once you have created your Battlenet account, and your WoW account, and subscribed to WoW, you need to download and install the game:</p>
         <ul>
         <li><p>
         Open the Blizzard game download page:<br>
         <a href="https://www.blizzard.com/en-us/download/">https://www.blizzard.com/en-us/download/</a>
         </p></li>
         <li><p>
         Download "World of Warcraft". That will start the download of the file "World-of-Warcraft-Setup.exe".
         </p></li>
         <li><p>
         Run "World-of-Warcraft-Setup.exe" to start the installation.
         That will start the installation of the Battlenet client. Using that client, you will install and start the game later on.
         </p></li>
         <li><p>
         Wait for the Battlenet client to be installed and launched. Then log in using your Battlenet account.
         </p></li>
         <li><p>
         The installation of the WoW game client will start automatically. Select "Start installation". There might be some popups. Just confirm them until you are in the Battlenet app.
         </p></li>
         <li><p>
         The Battlenet app has automatically started installing the regular WoW version (retail). However, we are playing the Classic TBC version of WoW. You need to start the installation of the Classic version manually. In the Battlenet app, select the dropdown menu below "Game Version". That dropdown currently has "World of Warcraft" selected. Select "Burning Crusade Classic" instead. Then select the "Install" button right below the dropdown.
         </p></li>
         <li><p>
         Review the installation options, and select "Start Installation".
         </p></li>
         <li><p>
         The "Install" button in the Battlenet app will change to "Installing". The installation is about 7 GB and may take some time. At some point the button in the Battlenet app will change from "Installing" to "Play".
         At that point select "Play" and the game will launch.
         </p></li>
         <li><p>
         Wait for the game to be launched (as soon as you hear music it is launched). Then quit the game (e.g. with ALT + F4). You need to complete some more steps in order to play!
         </p></li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Install addons and script</h3>
      <p>To play the game you need several addons and scripts. Those addons and scripts will add accessability features to the game. Here's how to set them up:</p>

      <ul>
         <li><p>
            You need the tool Autohotkey to move the mouse to certain positions in the game by pressing a key. You need to download and install Autohotkey using the following URL:<br>
            <a href="https://www.autohotkey.com/download/ahk-install.exe">https://www.autohotkey.com/download/ahk-install.exe</a>
         </p></li>
         <li><p>
            Then download all required addons. We have bundled them in a starter package. You will find that start package at the following URL:<br>
            <a href="https://1drv.ms/u/s!Aqgp3J_s6MM7iKVvu8sbItMWDFsP7g?e=crc0C9">https://1drv.ms/u/s!Aqgp3J_s6MM7iKVvu8sbItMWDFsP7g?e=crc0C9</a>
            That download is quite big too (about 540 MB). It may take quite a while.
         </p></li>
         <li><p>
            After downloading the starter package, open the installation directory of the "World of Warcraft" game client on your machine.<br>
            Assuming you accepted the default settings during installation, the directory most probably is "C:\Program Files (x86)\World of Warcraft". Otherwise, you'll have to manually find it.
         </p></li>
         <li><p>
            Open the folder "_classic_" in that directory. Then open the folder "Interface" and then "AddOns".
         </p></li>
         <li><p>
            Unzip all the folders and files from the downloaded starter package to that folder ("AddOns").<br>
            The starter package contains many, many, many files. Therefore, and depending on your machine, extracting them may take quite a lot time. That only happens during the initial setup and is expected.
         </p></li>
         <li><p>
            After extracting the files you will find many new folders in that "AddOns" folder. One of them is named "wow_menu". Open the folder "wow_menu".
         </p></li>
         <li><p>
            In the "wow_menu" folder you will find two script files named "wow-menu_EU.ahk" and "wow-menu_US.ahk". Choose the correct script for the region you've selected during subscribing to WoW. Either "wow-menu_EU.ahk" if your region is "Europe" or "wow-menu_US.ahk" of you region is "Americas & Oceania".<br>
            You need to start that script later to play the game. It will support you with character selection, looting and other things in the game. Therefore it might be helpful if you create a shortcut to that script on your desktop.<br>
            Attention: The script needs to stay in the folder. Don' not move it to the desktop. Create a link instead!<br>
            Then complete the following steps:</p>
            <ol>
               <li><p>Go to the folder "CopyTheContentOfThisFolderToInterface" in you "wow_menu" folder. There should be 3 folders in there.</p></li>
               <li><p>Copy all 3 folders ("DialogFrame", "GLUES", "HELPFRAME").</p></li>
               <li><p>Go to the "Interface" folder ("C:\Program Files (x86)\World of Warcraft\_classic_\Interface").</p></li>
               <li><p>Insert the just copied 3 folders in that "Interface" folder.</p></li>
            </ol>
            <p>Caution: You need to really carefully follow the instructions above. Do NOT just copy the full "wow_menu" folder from the downloaded .zip file to "Interface". That won't work.            
         </p></li>
         <li><p>
            Return to the "AddOns" folder (should be "C:\Program Files (x86)\World of Warcraft\_classic_\Interface\"). In that folder you will find a file named "Config.wtf". Copy that file.<br>
            In the WoW installation directory, navigate to the folder named "_classic_" (probably under "C:\Program Files (x86)\World of Warcraft\". From there navigate to the folder named "WTF". Paste the copied file "config.wtf" there. Overwrite the existing file.
         </p></li>
         <li><p>
            That's it. You are ready to play.
         </p></li>
      </ul>    

      <h3>Select a realms and create a character</h3>
      
      <h4>Start the game</h4>
      <p>You need to start the game again.</p>
      
      <ul>
      <li><p>
         The Battlenet app probably still is open. If not, launch it.
      </p></li>
      <li><p>
         Check if the "Burning Crusade Classic" is selected in the dropdown menu below "Game version" in the Battlenet app.
      </p></li>
      <li><p>
         Select "Play" right below the dropdown. The game will be launched.
      </p></li>
     </ul>
            
      <h4>Start the mouse script</h4>
         <ul>
         <li><p>
            To select a realm and create a character you need the script "wow-menu_EN_EU.ahk" or "wow-menu_EN_US.ahk" (depending on your region). Start the script via double click or "Run".
         </p></li>
         <li><p>
            The script has a voice prompt. It says "Paused" if it is started. It silently waits for the game to be started and launched. If it dectects the WoW game window the script automatically switches to "Login" mode.
         </p></li>
         <li><p>
            It says "Switched to Login". That means that the script is now in login mode, and will assist you with logging into the game, realm selection, and character creation.<br>
            Note: It will be helpful read/listen to the next steps on another device (tablet, smartphone, whatever is available). The mouse script will be activated every time the WoW window gets the focus. It pauses whenever the WoW window is losing the focus (for example, if you're switching to this page to listen to the next step). On every new activation (if you're switching back to the WoW window) it needs to be reinitialized and starts with the main menu again. All your previously completed steps in that script would be lost every time you are switching to another window and back. Reading/listening to the steps on another device would avoid that. Alternatively just read all the following steps and complete them without leaving the WoW window.
         </p></li>
         <li><p>
            The script performs an initialization and automatically gets you to the character selection screen of the game. While the script is processing, you will hear a sound. Wait for that sound to stop. Do not move the mouse, press any key or switch to other windows until processing is completed.
         </p></li>
         <li><p>
            After a while the sound stops and the script says "Main menu". Then you can use the script to select a realm.<br>
            Tip: If something wents wrong, then the script will try for 60 seconds to recognize the WoW window (it is playing the sound). Then the script stops (the sound stops) and asks you to restart the client and try that again. On some machines such issues were solved by starting the WoW client first and then starting the script. 
         </p></li>
      </ul>
            
      <h4>Select a realm</h4>
      <a>The first step is to choose one of the available realms (that will affect which other players you will meet) and to create a character.</a>

      <ul>
      <li><p>
         Press RIGHT to enter the submenus of the audio menu. There use DOWN and UP to browse though the submenus. The submenus are: "Select character", "Log in with selected character", "Create character" and "Change realm".
      </p></li>
      <li><p>
         You need to select a realm first. Go to "Change realm" and press RIGHT to enter the submenu of "Change realm". There you will find a list of languages (that are the languages for available realms). Select a language and move right to the submenu of the selected language. That submenu contains a list of all realms in that language. Select a realm. Then press ENTER to choose that realm.
      </p></li>
      <li><p>
         The script gets active and selects the new realm. You will hear the sound again. Don't do anything until the script has completed the process. Do not move the mouse. Do not press any key. Just put your hands in the air. :)
      </p></li>
      </ul>      
            
      <h4>Create a character</h4>
      <a>Now you need to to decide whether you would like to play Horde or Alliance. Your race depends on this. The race dictates the faction you become a member of in the game. Alliance includes Human, Dwarf, Night Elf, Gnome, and Draenei, and Horde includes Orc, Undead, Tauren, Troll, and Blood Elf.</a>
      
      <ul>
      <li><p>
         Once the script has changed the realm, you are back in the menu at "Select character". You don't have a character yet and have to create one first. Press DOWN to get to the menu item "Create character".
      </p></li>
      <li><p>
         Go right to the submenu. There you need to select the gender. Then go right again to select a race.
      </p></li>
      <li><p>
         <p>Select a race and go right again to the submenu. Now select the class of your character. The available classes depend on the selected race. Browse through the available classes with DOWN/UP. If you want, press LEFT to go back one menu level, select another race, and check out the classes available with that race. Browse around to see what classes are available with each race. Then select a race and a class and press ENTER.</p>
         <p>Tips for selecting races and classes:</p>
         <ul>
            <li><p>
               For the first steps, a casting healer is very helpful. That would be Priest or Druid.
            </p></li>
            <li><p>
               Melee classes like Warrior, Rogue and Paladin are not that suitable for the first steps.
            </p></li>
            <li><p>
               You can't change the race and class of the character later, but you can always create more characters with other races and classes.
            </p></li>
         </ul>            
         </p></li>
         <li><p>
            Again, wait for the script. It will create the character and ask you to enter a character name. Type your desired name and press ENTER. The script will check if that name is available and valid. If it is not, you will have to enter a new name and press ENTER again. That continues until the name is available and valid. Then the script actually creates the character and you end up back in the audio menu.<br>
            Tips on character names:</p>
            <ul>
               <li><p>
                  They must not contain the same letter three times or more consecutively.
               </p></li>
               <li><p>
                  They must not contain spaces.
               </p></li>
               <li><p>
                  They are not case sensitive. The first letter automatically is uppercase, all others are lowercase.
               </p></li>
            </ul>            
         </p></li>
         <li><p>
            Once you have created the character, it will automatically be placed in slot #1 of your character list. There are 10 slots for characters. New characters are automatically placed on the next free slot. So the next one you create would be slot #2 and so on.
         </p></li>
         <li><p>
            Write down the name, race, class and slot # of the created character. You need that later on. The script only works with the slot numbers, not with the names of the characters.
         </p></li>
         <li><p>
            Once you have created your first character, you can enter the game world with that character.
         </p></li>
         <li><p>
            In order to enter the world with your first character in slot #1, you first need to select that character. Go to "Select character", then right, and then select "Slot #1". Then press ENTER.
         </p></li>
         <li><p>
            The script will select the character in slot #1, and automatically switches to the "Log in with selected character" menu item. That is what you want to do. Just press ENTER to select the option.
         </p></li>
         <li><p>
            Now you are entering the game world with your new character. The script says "Switched to play", and will now be in play mode. If that doesn't happen, you can always press ALT + F1 to switch between login and play mode.
         </p></li>
         <li><p>
            There will be an introduction video playing, and you should hear a narrator. As soon as the narrator ends, you will find yourself in the game world at the starting location of your race.
         </p></li>
      </ul>      
      
      <h3>Configure the game</h3>
      <p>Before you start playing, you need to configure the game settings listed below. You need to set up the default key bindings for the game via the Sku addon. This is how you do it:</p>
            
      <ul>
      <li><p>
         Press SHIFT + F1 to open the Sku audio menu.
      </p></li>
      <li><p>
         That main audio menu is your go-to place for all the important activities in the game. All the things that only sighted people can do are available to you via that audio menu. So you will need SHIFT + F1 for the Sku audio menu all the time.
      </p></li>
      <li><p>
         The Sku audio menu works the same way as the audio menu you've used to create your character a few minutes ago. You can use DOWN and UP to move around in the current menu level, RIGHT to go down one menu level, and LEFT to go up one menu level. Use ENTER to select/activate/use the current menu item.
      </p></li>
      <li><p>
         Press DOWN to move to "Sku Core" and use RIGHT to enter its submenu.
      </p></li>
      <li><p>
         Press DOWN to move to "Game Key Bindings" and RIGHT to enter its submenu.
      </p></li>
      <li><p>
         Navigate to "Reset All" (should be the first item in the submenu) and enter the submenu with RIGHT.
      </p></li>
      <li><p>
         There select the option "Really reset? (no further warning)" with ENTER.
      </p></li>
      <li><p>
         Then close the sku audio menu with SHIFT + F1 or ESCAPE.
      </p></li>
      </ul>            
      <p>Now your key bindings are set to the standard Sku key bindings. More information on the audio menu and the key bindings can be found in the next chapter.</p>
      <p>Next you need to set up the AudioQS addon. That addon provides information on your health and mana.</p>
      
      <ul>
         <li><p>
            To do this, enter the following commands via the chat. Press ENTER to open the char input box. 
            Then enter the commands below and press ENTER to submit them. The interface will be reloaded after each of the first three commands. 
            Reloading the interface takes several seconds. Just wait until you hear the Sku Addon say "Outside". 
            Then you know that the reload is finished and you can input the next command.
            There won't be a reload after the fourth command.
         </p></li>
         <li><p>
            Enter the following commands one after the other:<br>
            /aq load healthmonitor<br>
            /aq load manamonitor<br>
            /aq load crowdcontrol<br>
            /aq mm 10 30 50 70 90<br>
         </p></li>
      </ul>

      <p>In a last step, you can personalize settings in the Sku addon. The most important one is the volume:</p>
      
      <ul>
      <li><p>
         Open the audio menu with SHIFT + F1.
      </p></li>
      <li><p>
         Navigate down to "Sku Options" and enter the the submenu.
      </p></li>
      <li><p>
         Navigate to the "Options" submenu.
      </p></li>
      <li><p>
         Move down to "Audio Channels" and enter the submenu.
      </p></li>
      <li><p>
         Move down to "Total Volume" and enter the submenu.
      </p></li>
      <li><p>
         In that submenu you can set the overall volume of the game from 0 to 100. Go up and down to a suitable volume. Then press ENTER to set the volume to that value. Change the overall volume to a level where you can easily hear the audio menu.
      </p></li>
      <li><p>
         Then go down one menu item to "Sound Effects Volume", and set the volume so that you can still hear the audio from Sku. If there are no sound effects (for example spell effects and combat sounds), you can return to the menu later and adjust the setting.
      </p></li>
      <li><p>
         Navigate down to "Environment Volume", "Music Volume" and "Dialog Volume" and adjust them too. (You can turn the music on and off with CTRL + M).
      </p></li>
      <li><p>
         Then close the audio menu with ESCAPE.
      </p></li>
      </ul>            
      <p>You are done. Now you are truly ready to play.</p>
