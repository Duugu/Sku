            <h1 id="c1">Known issues/bugs</h1>
            <h2 id="c1s1">Why did the addon suddenly stop reading the chat?</h2>
            <p>There is a bug within the Blizzard TTS implementation (that one is used to read the chat). It should be solved by just leaving the WoW client window and get back to it again. You don't need to close the client. Just change the focus to something else (desktop, application, whatever) and back to wow.</p>
               <p><a href="#c0">Back to content</a></p>
            <h1 id="c2">Installation, setup, server selection, character creation</h1>
            <h2 id="c2s1">What game version we're playing?</h2>
            <p>We're playing WoW The Burning Crusade Classic. NOT Warcraft Classic or Retail (that is named just World of Warcraft). The addon is only for WoW The Burning Crusade Classic. You can't use it with any other game version.</p>
               <p><a href="#c0">Back to content</a></p>
            <h2 id="c2s2">Can I use a starter account to test the game for free?</h2>
            <p>No, you can't. With the free starter account you can play/test the Retail game version only. You can't have access to what we're playing (WoW The Burning Crusade Classic). You need a payed subscription for that.</p>
               <p><a href="#c0">Back to content</a></p>
            <h2 id="c2s3">Which server / realm should I choose to play on?</h2>
            <p>Most blind players are on US East Pagle (Horde) or US Eeast Ashkandi (Horde)</p>
            <p>German EU players are on Germany &gt; Lakeshire (Alliance)</p>
               <p><a href="#c0">Back to content</a></p>
            <h2 id="c2s4">Is there a setup guide for Mac users?</h2>
            <p>At the moment no, sorry. We're working on that. You need to use the guide for windows and adapt that for Mac.</p>
               <p><a href="#c0">Back to content</a></p>
            <h2 id="c2s5">Can I play on all servers / realms? Even spanish or brazil?</h2>
            <p>Yes, if you set your client language to English. The server language doesn't matter.</p>
               <p><a href="#c0">Back to content</a></p>
            <h2 id="c2s6">Why is the script constantly switching to Login mode?</h2>
            <p>The script is quite complex and basicley has no information on what's actually happening in your wow game window. It is constantly testing a bunch of specific pixels and their colors in the game window, to get an idea on where you actually are in that window (login, character selection, in the game, etc.).</p>
            <p>There are numerous reasons why those checks could fail. There could be overlays from recording software or screen readers, there could be unsupported screen resolutions, and many other things, that leads to scenarios where the script can't detect those pixels and fails to detect the game window and its state.</p>
            <p>First of all, please try to start the game first, and then the script. That often leads to better results.</p>
            <p>If that doesn't help, please try to disable everything that could block the game window from being fully visible. An example are those weather, time, etc. widgets in Windows 11. They are covering parts of the game that the script is using to check for pixels. The script won't detect the pixels, the script assumes you're not in the game world, and swiches to login.</p>
               <p><a href="#c0">Back to content</a></p>
            <h2 id="c2s7">Is the TTS speed adjustable?</h2>
            <p>There are two different TTS engines in the game.</p>
            <p>The first one is our internal TTS, which is used for almost everything. For example for the audio menu, for reading quest text, etc. To adjust the speed of that go to "SkuOptions &gt; Options &gt; TTS speed" and change the number there. That number is the length of the silent gap between words. The default value is 85. With 65 there will be almost no gap between words. Values below 65 most probably will end up in a big, fat mess. The TTS speed will change after you have selected a new value and pressed enter on it.</p>
            <p>The second TTS engine is the Blizzard engine. That one is used for Chat (SHIFT + F2) and the Overview page (SHIFT + DOWN). To change the speed of that engine go to "SkuChat &gt; Options &gt; TTS speed" and change that value. Higher values are faster.</p>
               <p><a href="#c0">Back to content</a></p>
            <h2 id="c2s8">Why is the Range menu empty?</h2>
            <p>After login the addon needs up to one minute to calculate the available ranges. Until that is completed the menu is empty. The Range menu will show available range if the calculation is completed. You will here the addon saying "New range" if that happens. </p>
               <p><a href="#c0">Back to content</a></p>
            <h2 id="c2s9">What is the Skufluegel addon?</h2>
            <p>Skufluegel is an addon for sighted players that supports them in playing with visually impaird / blind players. That addon shows the sighted player what you're doing (looting, following, interacting, etc.) and provides them an option to remotly set you on follow. Just let them download the addon. There is a readme.txt file in that download, explaining the features.</p>
               <p><a href="#c0">Back to content</a></p>
            <h2 id="c2s10">How do I end the login / gaming script?</h2>
            <p>Press ALT + ESC. There's no audio feedback. The script task is just killed.</p>
               <p><a href="#c0">Back to content</a></p>
            <h2 id="c2s11">How do I delete characters?</h2>
            <p>You can't delete characters at the moment. Adding an option to that that via the login script is on our to do list, but it may take a while until that feature is available.</p>
               <p><a href="#c0">Back to content</a></p>
            <h2 id="c2s12">Where can I update the addons?</h2>
            <p>The update download page is: <a href="https://duugu.github.io/Sku">https://duugu.github.io/Sku</a></p>
            <p>There are automated notifications in the Discord channel "Sku updates" (<a href="https://discord.com/channels/944053322434879628/944061589420662825">https://discord.com/channels/944053322434879628/944061589420662825</a>) on every new release.</p>
               <p><a href="#c0">Back to content</a></p>
            <h2 id="c2s13">Do I need a numpad to use the addon / play the game?</h2>
            <p>It would be very, very helpful, but it isn't 100% required.</p>
               <p><a href="#c0">Back to content</a></p>
            <h2 id="c2s14">Can I change the key bindings from NUMPAD 7-9 to something else?</h2>
            <p>You can't, sorry.</p>
               <p><a href="#c0">Back to content</a></p>
            <h1 id="c3">General gameplay</h1>
            <h2 id="c3s1">Where do I get details on my current HP / mana?</h2>
            <p>You should have enabled the addon "audio qs" during setup. It should start saying "one, one, one" if you're losing HP. The faster that "one, one, one" is, the lower your HP. Mana should be announced by the same addon, in steps of 90, 70, 50, 30 and 10 percent.</p>
            <p>To manually check you HP / mana, press SHIFT + DOWN to open the overview page (you need to have the menu closed to have that working). Hold shift and repeatingly press DOWN to get to the "General" section. You HP and Mana should be in that section.</p>
               <p><a href="#c0">Back to content</a></p>
            <h2 id="c3s2">How to I collect objects in the game world (like cactus apples)?</h2>
               <p>First, use a waypoint to that object (there are waypoints to all objects in the game) to navigate to its position.</p>
               <p>Then you are using scan and interact with mouseover for interacting with objects in the game world, fishing, finding corpses and more.</p>
               <p>Scanning is automatically turning your camera around you (and thus the mouse pointer) very fast.</p>
               <p>While doing that it is constantly checking if the mouse pointer is getting over an object.</p>
               <p>If that is the case it instantly stops turning, and thus your mouse pointer will be on the object.</p>
               <p>With the mouse pointing on the object you then can press the new shortcut Shift + G (interact with mouse over) to right click on that object.</p>
               <p>Shift + G is working like the shortcut G (interact with target), except it is interacting with the object under your mouse, instead of your current target.</p>
               <p>Your character will either directly use the object (if you are in use range), or move to the object and use it then.</p>
               <p>The scan stops on the first found object (see below for what objects the different scans are looking for).</p>
               <p>You then can either press SHIFT + G to interact with that object, or using SHIFT + L to continue the scan to find another object of that type.</p>
               <p>A running scan will be instantly stopped if you do start moving.</p>
               <p>The different scans:</p>
               <p>There are 8 different scans available. They have different ranges and accuracies and they are scanning for different objects. You will find details on them below this list.</p>
               <ul>
               <li><p>Scan 1: SHIFT + U, 360 10 fast, herbs, mining nodes</p></li>
               <li><p>Scan 2: SHIFT + I, 100 Front, fishing bobber</p></li>
               <li><p>Scan 3: SHIFT + O, 360 10 fast, usable objects</p></li>
               <li><p>Scan 4: SHIFT + P, 360 10 fast, lootable corpse, skinnable corpse</p></li>
               <li><p>Scan 5: CONTROL + SHIFT + U, 360 30 fast, herb, mining nodes</p></li>
               <li><p>Scan 6: CONTROL + SHIFT + O, 360 30 fast, usable objects</p></li>
               <li><p>Scan 7: CONTROL + SHIFT + P, 360 30 fast, lootable corpse, skinnable corpse</p></li>
               <li><p>Scan 8: CONTROL + SHIFT + I, 360 30 accurate, any</p></li>
               </ul>
               <p>Details on the scans:</p>
               <p>Each scan (1-8) consists of a specific scan type and a list of objects it is scanning for.</p>
               <p>You can assign or adjust any combination of scan type and object(s) to each of those 8 scans. To do that go to Core > Scan settings and to the specific scan (1-8).</p>
               <p>There are 5 different scan types to choose from. They differ in scan range, accuracy and speed.</p>
               <ul>
               <li><p>Scan type 1: 100 front - 100 degrees in front of you, 5-45 meters range, takes up to 22 seconds. Used for fishing.</p></li>
               <li><p>Scan type 2: 360 10, fast - 360 degrees around you, 0-10 meters, takes up to 10 seconds. Used for usual quick scanning of objects near you.</p></li>
               <li><p>Scan type 3: 360 30, fast - 360 degrees around you, 3-30 meters, takes up to 15 seconds. Used for usual quick scanning of objects in up to 30 meters range.</p></li>
               <li><p>Scan type 4: 360 10, accurate - 360 degrees degrees around you, 0-10 meters, takes up to 15 seconds. The more accurate version of scan type 2, if you can’t find an object with scan 2.</p></li>
               <li><p>Scan type 5: 360 30, accurate - 360 degrees degrees around you, 3-30 meters, takes up 28 seconds. The more accurate version of scan type 3, if you can’t find an object with scan 3.</p></li>
               </ul>
               <p>And there are 12 different object types you can choose to scan for:</p>
               <ul>
               <li><p>corpse lootable: any corpse that is lootable</p></li>
               <li><p>corpse skinnable: any corpse that is skinnable</p></li>
               <li><p>corpse not lootable: any corpse that is NOT lootable</p></li>
               <li><p>any creature: any creature (mob, npc, player, etc.)</p></li>
               <li><p>quest object: any object in the game world that is required for any of your current quests</p></li>
               <li><p>herb: any herb for herbalism (only herbs are considered that are set to On under Core > Options > Resource scanning > Herbs)</p></li>
               <li><p>vein: any mining node (only mining nodes are considered that are set to On under Core > Options > Resource scanning > Mining nodes)</p></li>
               <li><p>bobber: the fishing bobber</p></li>
               <li><p>usable object: any object that is usable/clickable (for example a mailbox)</p></li>
               <li><p>any object: any object in the game world</p></li>
               <li><p>target creature: the creature your are currently targeting (mob, npc, player, etc.)</p></li>
               <li><p>any: any object in the game world</p></li>
               </ul>
               <p>Just go to Core > Scan settings and to the scan (1-8) you would like to configure/adjust. Then select a new scan type and/or add/remove object categories, to adjust that scan.</p>
               <p>Helpful information on scanning:</p>
               <p>Some “objects” don’t count as objects. Examples are mage portals, meeting stones, dungeon portals. To find them, use a scan that is scanning for “any”. (default: scan 8, Control + Shift + I)</p>
               <p>Scanning is turning the camera. That is working perfect on flat terrain. It can be problematic if there slopes, in buildings, etc. If a fast scan isn’t detecting an object, just try an accurate scan.</p>
               <p>It can also be difficult if objects are covered by other objects (like mobs or players). Or if there are several objects at the same place (like 2 or 3 corpses almost at the same position).</p>
               <p>Small objects can be easily overlooked by fast scans. Set up scans to use an “accurate” scan type (4 or 5) to find those objects.</p>
               <p>Scanning can fail in some cases. Then the camera is turning slightly to far. If you do a scan, and there is an object, but nothing happens with Shift + G, just retry the scan.</p>
               <p>Scanning is finding a mob or object at the position where it is right now. If a mob is moving, then it naturally will move away from the mouse cursor if you don’t press Shift + G as fast as possible on finding it.</p>
               <p>If you are continuing a scan, then only the first object of each type will be found, as the addon can’t differentiate between more objects of the same type. This only applies to objects. Not to corpses, mobs, etc.</p>
               <p>If you would like to choose a new key binding for a specific scan, go to Core > Sku key binds > Bind key and filter for “scan”.</p>
               <p>To change the sound on scanning go to Core > Options > Scan Background Sound</p>
               <p>If you aren't successful with scanning, there most probably is no item to collect. The waypoints for those items are not showing the items. Those waypoints are just spawn points. That means, there COULD be an item at that point. But it might not be there. If someone else collected that item at that waypoint before you, then it may take a while until the items respawn. In those cases just open the audio menu and navigate to another waypoint for that object. Most objects do have many spawn points.</p>

            <h2 id="c3s3">How / where do I repair my equipment?</h2>
            <p>Most weapon/armor vendors do repair. Usually you don't need to do that manually. It's enough to get to such a merchant and interact with it. The addon automatically repairs your stuff if you're interacting with a merchant who provides the option to repair. If you have enough money.</p>
            <p>To find such a merchant look for waypoints with armor, weapon, smith, etc. added to the vendors name. Then follow the route to that merchant.</p>
            <p>If you would like to manually repair, interact with such a merchant, and find the Repair option in the audio menu.</p>
            <p>Important: There are some fake waypoints for merchants and trainers in the lists (long story, Blizzards fault in short 😊). Those waypoints are not real NPCs. However, they are easy to recognize. ALL real NPCs do have names. A first name and a last name, or just a first name. But there always is a name. Like Cairne Bloodhoof, Weapon merchant. If you get a waypoint without a name in it (like just Weapon merchant), then that is a fake waypoint. Don't use it.</p>

            <h2 id="c3s4">How do I find available quests?</h2>
            <p>Open your questbook with L. The audio menu opens with your questlog selected. If you don't have any quests yet, go down to Quest database, right to Starts in zone, right again to by distance and right again. There you will find a comprehensive list of all quests you could accept on your current level, sorted by the distance to the quest giver.</p>
            <p>Select a quest, go right and choose Quest start to see the name of the quest giver. Go right again, and you will be able to start a route, close route or waypoint navigation to that questgiver. If you have no idea what a route is, read How do I navigate using waypoints, routes and close routes? first!</p>
               <p><a href="#c0">Back to content</a></p>
            <h2 id="c3s5">How to I get my current distance to an NPC / creature?</h2>
            <p>There is a feature to have the distance to NPCs and creatures announced. But you do need to enable that. It's SkuCore > Range. There are different settings for friendly, hostile and unknown targets. (Unknown are things like the corpse of a dead creature.)</p>
            <p>You can set up a lot of different alerts for different distances. Spoken, or just a sound. Go through those options, set sounds for the target types, and test it.</p>
               <p><a href="#c0">Back to content</a></p>
            <h2 id="c3s6">Where do I get details on what abilities are on my action bars and how to I customise that?</h2>
            <p>Go to SkuCore &gt; Action bars &gt; Main action bar. That's your first action bar (there are 6 of them). Go right to see the 12 slots of that bar and what's currently assigned to each slot.</p>
            <p>If you just started the game, there's the attack ability assigned to button 1. And that button 1 is bound to the keyboard key 1. What is on button 2-5 depends on your class. Just go down to see all buttons and their assignments. If you would like to know what that action is, just read the tooltip for that button (press shift + down arrow on that menu entry, hold SHIFT and repleatly press DOWN to read the text).</p>
            <p>If you would like to assign abilities to action bar slots, select the slot, and go right. Go down and you will find submenus with different categories for abilities. Choose an ability from one of the submenus, and press enter to assign that ability to the specific action bar slot.</p>
               <p><a href="#c0">Back to content</a></p>
            <h2 id="c3s7">What is that attack ability on my action bar and how is it working?</h2>
            <p>The attack ability (default action button 1, which is bound to the key 1), also named auto attack, is a toggle ability for melee combat.</p>
            <p>All other abilities are single use. Press an action button with a spell, and you will cast one spell. Press an action button with food, an you will eat exactly one food.</p>
            <p>attack is the only ability that will be toggled instead. Press the attack action button once to toggle melee combat on. Your character will start attacking your target (if you are in melee range) and constantly keep attacking. Press the button again, to toggle attack to off, and your character will stop attacking.</p>
            <p>Due to that it makes no sense to spam that attack button. You just would constantly toggle the attack on and off, leading to no attacks at all. Instead, press it just once at the start of combat, to enable auto attack, and just let your character do the rest.</p>

            <h2 id="c3s8">How do I find a merchant to sell or buy stuff?</h2>
            <p>Use waypoints or routes to waypoints with merchants (if you have no idea what that means, read How to navigate using waypoints, routes and close routes first). In waypoint lists filter for terms like goods, weapons, armor, merchant to find merchants.</p>
            <p>Important: There are some fake waypoints for merchants and trainers in the lists (long story, Blizzards fault :)). Those waypoints are not real NPCs. However, they are easy to recognize. ALL real NPCs do have names. A first name and a last name, or just a first name. But there always is a name. Like Cairne Bloodhoof, Weapon merchant.

            <h2 id="c3s10">How do I get money?</h2>
               <p>In WoW everyone always struggles with money problems at the beginning. That's why it's important to find a way to make more money.
               <h3>General tipps</h3>
               <p>Inventory: In the beginning you start off with only one bag with 16 or 20 slots, where all your loot goes to. Of course you can find new bags or earn them and thus increase your inventory with up to 4 additional bags. Additionally you have slots for bags in the bank, which can be found in every capital city. You can also buy larger bags from a fellow player, whose profession is Tailor. Or learn tailoring yourself.</p>
               <p>Some important notes about inventory: Whenever you are in any city/settlement/outpost, find a nearby merchant to sell the scrap in your bag or bags. This way you can free up some room. There's nothing more frustrating than finally managing to loot a quest item, only to find you don't have enough room in your inventory to pick it up.</p>
               <h3>How to actually make gold</h3>
               <p>Method1: Farming and selling stuff to a NPC merchant</p>
               <p>Kill enemies of any kind, loot them and sell everything to a NPC merchant nearby. That would be the easiest method, but also the most inefficient one because you sell valueable loot below value.</p>
               <p>Method2: Farming and selling at the auction house</p>
               <p>The general idea here is still the same, kill enemies and sell their loot. However, when using this method, you will only sell the actual scrap to the NPC vendor. The other loot is to be sold at an auction house, which can be found in capital cities.</p>
               <p>Risk: When selling through the AH, you have to make a down payment at the time of sale, depending on the duration of the campaign and the estimated value. You won't get this back, even if you haven't sold anything.</p>
               <p>Advantage: Depending on the item, you get anywhere from 50% to 1000% or more than you would receive from the NPC vendor.</p>
               <p>Method3: Farming, disenchant part of the items and sent mats from disenchanting to a banking character</p>
               <p>You should create a char that does nothing other than manage or sell goods sent by your other chars. All this character would really do is hang out in a capital city and run back and forth between the bank, mailbox and auction house. The advantage is that your chars, the ones you're actually playing, don't have to come to the capital to sell their loot all the time. Note, however, that shipping costs 30 coppers per slot/stack. For the rest it's the exact same procedure as the one used for method 2.</p>
               <p>Method 4: Farming, disenchant part of the items and sent mats from disenchanting to a banking character</p>
               <p>Similar to Method 3, but the "special" (green) equipment is disenchanted and the material obtained from disenchanting is sold. The advantage is that the disenchantment materials are more valueable most of the time than the "special" (green) equipment and are more valueable and therefore sold easily. For advanced and experienced player it is recommended to have an enchanter and a tailor (bags!) as a banking character.</p>

            <h1 id="c4">Navigation</h1>
            <h2 id="c4s1">How do I navigate using waypoints, routes and close routes?</h2>
            <p>There are basically three options to navigate to destinations: routes, close routes, and waypoints.</p>
            <h3>Waypoints</h3>
            <p>Waypoints (SHIFT + F9 or SkuNav &gt; Waypoints &gt; Select) are just single locations. Every creature, NPC, object, etc. in the game has a waypoint with coordinates assigned to it. If you select a waypoint, a beacon will lead you in a straight line to that position. That can work, but in most cases it won't, because there are obstacles in your way and you get stuck. Buildings, fences, trees, walls and millions of other structures. You even could be in the middle of a cave, and your destination waypoint is outside of that cave. You obviously can't move in a straight line to the destination waypoint in such scenarios.</p>
            <h3>Routes</h3>
            <p>For such scenarios there are routes. Routes are paths over multiple linked waypoints. There is a very, very large network of such linked waypoints, that virtually links almost every waypoint with all other waypoints. Those routes (paths via many linked waypoints) are pre-built by sighted players with blind navigation in mind. That means they are always safe to follow. If you're using a route to your target destination, the addon leads you via those linked waypoints to that destination. There won't be any obstacles if you follow a route. The route will safely lead you around everything where you could get stuck.</p>
            <p>There are different ways to start a route. Via the questlog. Or via SkuNav &gt; Follow route &gt; Destinations by distance (SHIFT + F10). Let's assume you're using SkuNav &gt; Follow route &gt; Destinations by distance to get a route to a specific destination.</p>
            <p>SkuNav &gt; Follow route &gt; Destinations by distance first shows an entry point. That usually is the closest waypoint to your current position that is linked to the routes network (not all waypoints are linked to the network). The menu entry could be something like x meters, auto or x meters . It doesn't really matter, because that's just the entry point where your route will start. Go right, and the addon shows a list of all destinations (sorted by distance) that could be reached via the network of linked waypoints from that entry point. Find your destination in that list. Type the name of your target or a part of that name, to have the list filtered, if you can't find it. Then choose the destination and press enter to start following a route to that destination.</p>
            <p>Doing that via the quest log basically is the same. Just choose a quest start, quest target, or quest end first. You will find the same thing there (an entry point and in its submenu the destinations that can be reached from there).</p>
            <p>Then the addon calculates a safe route over two or many linked waypoints to that destination. There won't be any obstacles, you won't be stuck in a cave, or whatever. Just follow the route from one waypoint to the next.</p>
            <h3>Close routes</h3>
            <p>The third option is close routes. As stated, not all waypoints are connected to the routes network. So, there are waypoints you can't directly get to via routes. An example for that is Quick Waypoint 4. If you die, Quick Waypoint 4 is automatically set to the position of your corpse. It obviously won't be pre-linked to the network. That is what close routes are good for. A close route leads you via the routes network as close as possible to the unlinked destination waypoint. Then, in a last step, it leads you from there to the actual destination waypoint in a straight line. That means, it's like a route (safe to follow, no obstacles) except the very last step (one waypoint to your destination left). That last step is just like following a waypoint. There could be obstacles if you're unlucky. However, in most cases it does the trick.</p>
            <p>Conclusion: Always try to use a route first. If there isn't any route to your destination, try to use a close route. If that doesn't work, OR if you are quite sure that there are no obstacles, try to use a waypoint.</p>
               <p><a href="#c0">Back to content</a></p>
            <h2 id="c4s2">I died. What now?</h2>
            <p>If you're dying, and you will die a lot :D, you first need to release your spirit. The audio menu will open with a dialog to do that. (Text: 6 Minutes until release, go down to release spirit, go right to left click, press enter).</p>
            <p>You then will be teleported to the next graveyard as a ghost and have two options: you can get back to your corpse to resurrect there, or you can talk to a spirit healer at the graveyard, to be resurrected right there.</p>
            <h3>1. Get back to your corpse</h3>
            <p>You usually will try to get back to your corpse as a ghost. For that the addon automatically sets a waypoint named Quick waypoint 4 to the position of your corpse. You need to navigate to that waypoint. It is selected as default, and you already should hear the beacon. Do not try to follow that beacon, because it is a beacon directly to that waypoint (read How to navigate using waypoints, routes and close routes first if you have no idea what that means). You most probably will get stuck before you're reaching it.</p>
            <p>Use a close route to Quick Waypoint 4 instead. Press SHIFT + F9 to open the waypoint selection menu. Find Quick waypoint 4 in that list (filter with quick). Move right. Do NOT select Select, because that would start a navigation directly to that waypoint, which most probably won't work. Move down to Close routes instead. There move right twice to get a list of all routes that will lead you close to your corpse (Quick waypoint 4). Usually the first one is the best. Select that to start the navigation via that route to your corpse.</p>
            <p>Follow the route to your corpse. If you are getting at least 35 meters close to your corpse, the game will show a popup to resurrect. The audio menu opens, go down to Accept, and right to Left click. Then press enter, and you are resurrected.</p>
            <h3>2. Resurrect at the graveyard</h3>
            <p>If you die at a place with many mobs around, resurrecting at your corpse may be quite challenging or even impossible. You probably will instantly be attacked by all mobs nearby and get killed again. Or you probably died at a place where you just can't navigate back to your corpse.</p>
            <p>In such cases you can resurrect at the graveyard. However, that has some drawbacks: All of your items (even those in your bags) will take some damage (20%). That raises your repair costs. And, starting from level 11, you will get a 10 minute debuff on resurrecting at a graveyard. That debuff lowers all of your stats to a point where you basically can't fight anymore, and need to wait 10 minutes until you lose that debuff.</p>
            <p>There is an npc named spirit healer at each graveyard. Just target that npc (/tar spirit) and press g to interact. The audio menu opens, showing a dialog. Go right, down, right, down, right, down to Return me to life. Go right to Left click and press ENTER to use that. The game warns you twice that there are drawbacks. Go down to Accept and right to Left click, to confirm that. Do that again to confirm the second warning, and you are resurrected.</p>

            <h2 id="c4s3">I've accidentally closed the Resurrect popup at my corpse. What now?</h2>
            <p>Move more than 35 meters away from your corpse (press CTRL + ALT to get the distance to it), and then move back to the corpse. The resurrect popup should appear again. Or, just use /reload. The popup should be there after the reload.</p>

            <h2 id="c4s4">I've accidentally closed the release spirit popup after dying. What now?</h2>
            <p>Open the chat, enter /script RepopMe() and press ENTER to automatically release your spirit. Alternatively use /reload.</p>
            <h2 id="c4s5">I've navigated to a waypoint, but there isn't any NPC, creature, etc. I can't target anything.</h2>
            <p>There are some fake waypoints for merchants and trainers in the lists (long story, Blizzards fault in short :)). Those waypoints are not real NPCs. However, they are easy to recognize. ALL real NPCs do have names. A first name and a last name, or just a first name. But there always is a name. Like Cairne Bloodhoof, Weapon merchant. If you get a waypoint without a name in it (like just Weapon merchant), then that is a fake waypoint. Don't use it.</p>

            <p>If a creature is dead you will stop targeting it. Just press H to re-target the last target (the dead creature). Then press G to interact with the corpse and get the loot.</p>
