- Sku Addon Release Notes
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in Sku r34.14
	- Added more sorting options to the Sort and Cleanup menus:
		- Sort items by quality ascending / descending
		- Sort items by name ascending / descending
	- The addon now is locking the keyboard while any bag sorting or cleanup process is running


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in Sku r34.13
	- The addon now is auto-enabling the nameplates for all units
	- Renamed the setting "Don't vocalize reaction and level for players in combat" to "Don't vocalize the reaction (friendly or hostile) and the level for players while in combat"
	- Added new options to the bags and bank slots: 
		Every bag has a new "Sort and cleanup" menu after the last bag slot/item in the bag. It is to sort or cleanup the items in the specific bag.
		In the main bag menu is a "Sort and cleanup" menu entry after the last bag. It applies to ALL open bags. Even the bank, if the bank is open.
		Under "Sort and cleanup" you will find actions to sort or clean the bag or bags. Right now there is only one action:
		- "Move all items to the top of the bag (collapse)": That is, if the items are spread all over the bag, and there are empty slots in between, all items will be moved, so that all empty bag slots are at the end of the bag. The items order won't change with this. 
		I will add more sorting/cleaning options with the next release. At least "Sort items by quality". I am open for suggestions what sorting/cleaning options could be helpful.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in Sku r34.12
	- Added a new option: Mob > Options > Don't vocalize reaction and level for players in combat. Default: on
	- Addded a new key bind: Sku key binds > Turn 180 degrees. Default: not bound. It is instantly (in 0.1 seconds) turning you around by 180 degrees. Can by used while moving. The feature again depends on your fps / computer performance. Should be quite accurate with high fps and no lags. Will get less accurate otherwise. Please provide feedback if it isn't working correctly for you.
	- Fixed a bug where using the Turn to Unit key binds while moving was opening the menu on stop moving.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in Sku r34.11
	- Fixed an issue with tutorials where the tutorial could break after starting the route to the first quest target.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in Sku r34.10
	- Added a new feature: turn to unit. 
		This is auto turning you to units like your target, party members, mobs with game markers like Skull, or mobs with sku markers like Blue.
		The feature is not 100% accurate. Sometimes it is turning you straight to the unit. Sometimes it ends up left or right of the unit. It gets less accurate the closer the unit is. It gets less accurate the faster the speed setting is (see below). It depends on your machines speed/your fps. Faster is more accurate. Low fps can lead to completely inaccurate results.
		It works reliably with units up to 41 meters away. If the unit is more than 41 meters away, the success rate will be quite worse. It works everywhere. Open world, dungeons, even battlegrounds. It works for all unit types. However, the unit must by on your physical level. Units above or below you, or units behind walls etc. won't work.
		There are 6 new keybindings to use this feature: Sku key binds > Turn to unit 1-6. They are are bound to no key by default. Each keybind is turning you to a different unit (see below). 1 is your target, 2 is skull, 3 is cross, 4 is square, and 5 & 6 are nothing
		There are settings under Core > Options > Turn to target:
			- Unit selection:  This is where you set the units for the 6 key bindings. The default units for key 1-6 are: target, skull, cross, square, nothing, nothing
			- Speed: the faster, the less accurate
			- Enhanced settings: do not touch unless prompted
	- Fixed a bug with the Human tutorials step "start navigation to class trainer"
	- Changed "heavy armor" to "chain armor" in tutorial texts
	- Fixed an issue with missing success sound in tutorials if you are not on the latest SkuAudiodata version
	- It is now possible to use the "next step" key bind (default: ALT + J) to jump to the next tutorial step even if you haven't completed the current step. You will hear a warning and need to confirm by pressing ALT + J again to actually jump to the next step. This most likely will break the tutorial and is not recommended.
	- Fixed the missing "dead" output on targeting dead targets
	- Added a Core > Dungeon and raid settings menu to set the difficulty if you are the party/raid leader
	- Fixed an issue with missing audio outputs for female creatures in German
	- Fixed an issue on Mac clients where tts outputs could not be canceled anymore. This will break the tutorials feature on Mac clients, but I can't do anything to avoid that. It's Blizzards fault.
	- Fixed an issue with "auto" waypoints incorrectly showing up in the waypoint list (shift + f9)
	- The addon is now outputting generic emojis like in chat messages as text that is correctly read by tts voices.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in Sku r34.9
	- Fixed an issue with outdated audio data versions that lead to missing audio outputs for mobs (like health, name, etc). You nevertheless should update to SkuAudioData en r10 (ENGLISH) or SkuAudioData r38 (GERMAN) via https://duugu.github.io/Sku/ if you not already did that.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in Sku r34.8
	- The newbie tutorials are ready. :)
	Right now there are tutorials for:
	- Human: Warriors, Paladins, Rogues, Priests, Mages, and Warlocks
	- Night Elf: Hunters, and Druids.
	Other race / class combos may follow.
	The tutorials are for absolute beginners, with literally zero knowledge on the game, the addon, or mmo games in general.
	New players will get an audio hint that there are tutorials and how to start them on the very first login with their first character. 
	Each tutorial will take between 1.5 and 2.5 hours if time to be completed (depending on the players speed).
	All tutorials need to be tested in English and German. So, if you would like to help, and test a tutorial, you just need to create a new character using one of the available race / class combos listed above. Then login and follow the instructions.
	Any feedback is appreciated. If you really would like to help with building more tutorials or building your own tutorials, please let me know.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in Sku r34.7
	- Fixed a bug with the Sku target markers. Shoud now assign different colors if Mob > Options > Auto set private Sku raid targets on in combat targets without a raid target is set to On. :)
	- Sku target markers won't be removed from dead mobs anymore. Instead all Sku target markers are removed if combat ends.
	- Fixed a bug with some quest panel that was causing the panel to open again and again on escape.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in Sku r34.6
	- Fixed a bug with tutorials and npc id tags
	- On following a route or waypoint, if the reached waypoint is on a different layer than the previous waypoint, the addon is outputing the layer number. That way you should realize if you are changing layers while on a route (moving a floor up or down, moving ramps up/down, etc.). There's no output if the waypoint has no layer number assigned.
	- Fixed a bug with missing sound for units that are already in combat. Should now be the beep sound as default.
	- Added a filter to automatically remove the annoying "Citizens of Dalaran..." outputs that Rhonin is doing if someone has killed Algalon. Removes the chat and audio output.
	- Added a new chat feature: Chat > Filter. You can add and remove filter terms or phrases to a list. If a chat message contains any filter term, it will be ignored for all chat tabs. Keep that in mind. If you are adding very generic terms, then a lot of messages could be filterd. :) Filter terms are not case-sensitive. Filter terms are stored per Sku profile.
	- Added a new feature: private Sku target markers
		Sku target markers are similar to the games target markers (Skull, Cross, Moon, etc.), but they are using colors instead of symbold and they private to you. They are not visible for other players.
		The colors are: White, Red, Blue, Green, Purple, Yellow, Orange
		The Sku target markers are to uniquely mark and identify units.
		Example, if you are fighting three Young Boars, you can privately mark the first one with White, the second with Red, and the third with Blue.
		The sku target markers are added before the mob name. Similar to the standard raid target markers.
		So, with the second Young Boar marked with "Blue", you will hear "Blue Young Boar Level..." on targeting that boar.
		That way you can uniquely identify all mobs, even if they have the same name.
		As stated, the Sku markers are private and additionally to the games standard target markers. 
			So, even in a group they won't mix up with the standard target markers, an won't confuse other players.
		There are two ways to set sku target markers:
			- There are 8 new key binds for them: Core > Sku key binds > bind key > Set Sku target marker x. (Just filter for "sku target marker")
			- There is a new option to auto-assign them: Mob > Options > Auto set private Sku raid targets on in combat targets without a raid target. Default: Off. 
				With this set to On, the addon will auto assign a Sku marker to every unit that is in combat with you and don't have and marker (Sku or Game) yet.
				Markers will be removed if a unit dies.
				There is a sku key bind to additionally clear all assigned Sku markers at once.
		Some more details:
			- A unit can't have a sku marker and a game marker. Therefore the games target markers are overriding the sku target markers. 
				If you have privately marked a mob as blue, and you or someone else is marking that mob as the default target marker "Skull", then Blue will just be replaced by Skull.
			- The default games Remove Target Marker feature is used to remove a sku marker. 
				That is under Core > Game key binds > Assign key > Target markers > Remove target marker. The default binding is Control + numpad 0.
			- Good to know: for easier referencing the sku target markers are using the same colors as the games target marker symbols have: 
				Skull = White, Cross = Red, Square = Blue, Triangle = Green, Diamond = Purple, Star = Yellow, Circle = Orange, Moon = Grey


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in Sku r34.5
	- Re-enabled the instant distance output on hard targeting a unit
	- Fixed a bug with the tutorial editor and steps that are converted from linked steps to real steps


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in Sku r34.4
	- More routes for Terokkar added by Emily
	- Layers and waypoint names updated and map issues fixed for Darkshore, Darnassus, Teldrassil, Rut'theran, Moonglade (parts)
	- Removed an overlooked debug output from the overview page
	- Final updates of the tutorial FTUE


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in Sku r34.3
	- Fixed a bug that was causing an error on changing actions bar sets (on switching stance, entering vehicles, etc). Thx @Chaosbringer.
	- Slightly changed the "Toggle player, party, raid health monitor" key bind. If you are solo it is toggleing the player health monitor on/off. If you are in a party, it is switching between party health and player health monitor. If you are in a raid it is switching between player health and raid health.
	- Added better chat outputs for the "Toggle player, party, raid health monitor" key bind.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in Sku r34.2
	- Added a new option Core > Range > Range for group members in range checks (default: 10), and a new key bind "Do group members in range check" (default: not bound). This is to output the number of party or raid members that a inside the selected range to you.
	- Added a new option: Mob > Options > Sound if target is in combat, to change the default beep sound on targeting enemies that are already in combat to something else. Default value: "Default beep sound".
	- Added the spells from patch 3.4.1 to the database (hc+ stuff etc.).
	- Fixed a bug with adding all steps from an existing tutorial as linked steps.
	- Fixed an issue with creating multi line macros.
	- The raid roster on the overview page (default on overview page 2 with shift + up), has been fixed to use the same order as the games standard raid frame.
	- Several changes in Core > Monitor:
		- Removed the party health chord style monitor
		- Added raid health and debuff monitors. There are options for enabling/disabling outputs per subgroup, new roles like MTs, etc. Please adjust them to restrict the number of outputs in raids to a level that is useful for you.
		- Player Health, Player Power, and Pet Health outputs are slightly changed to announce the expected numbers. Examples: down from 81% hp to 79% hp the monitor is now announcing "8" instead of "7" as before
		- The player, party, and raid health monitors are now automatically used depending on the group type (if the appropiate monitor is set to On in the settings). If you are solo, its player, if you are in a party, its party, etc.
		- Added a new sku key bind: "Toggle player, party, raid health monitor". Default set to nothing. It is to toggle the currently active health monitor (player, party, raid) on/off.
	- Added a new targeting feature for party/raid members. I am calling it "dial targeting", because you are "dialing" the target via the numpad using the raid members number.
		It is disabled as default. You need to explicit enable the feature via Core > Dial Targeting. Can be set to auto enable in parties, raids, both or never.
		With Dial Targeting you're using the numpad to target any specific raid member in any raid size (10, 25, 40) by just typing the raid members number.
		The raid members number is just a running number. Members 1-5 in raid group 1 have the raid member numbers 1 to 5. Members 1-5 in raid group 2 are 6 to 10. Members in raid group 3 are 11 to 15, and so on.
		Typing the raid members number always uses two digits, with a leading zero for numbers below 10. So, to target raid member 1, you will enter 0 1 (zero one). Two is 0 2 (zero two) and raid member 9 is 0 9 (zero nine). Raid member 10 is 1 0 (one zero), and so on.
		As stated, Dial Targeting is disabled as default. To enable the feature, go to Core > Dial Targeting. You will also find other self explaining options there.
		Dial Targeting has three numpad keys with custom actions:
			- Numpad zero twice (aka raid member number 0 0) is always you.
			- Numpad decimal separator (English) or Numpad comma (German) is resetting the input and clearing your target. That is, for example, if you started with typing 1, and then, before typing in the second number for the raid member, would like to start over to choose 0 and 1 instead. With resetting the input the addon then will take the next number not as the second, but as the first.
			- Numpad Enter is to re-target the the last target you've selected via Dial Targeting
		If Dial Targeting is enabled, all existing key binds on numpad keys will be temporary disabled. The old key binds will be restored after Dial Targeting was disabled.
		If you are enabling dial targeting, you of course can't use the sku menu script shortcuts for numpad 7-9 (clicking on the ground, turning to beacon). With menu script r3.12 or higher they will be automatically disabled while Dial Targeting is enabled. With older menu script versions you need to manually exit the script (ALT + ESCAPE) to have dial targeting working.
		In parties (if enabled for parties) Dial Targeting is using one digit party member numbers (1-4 for party member 1 to 4, and 0 for yourself).
		Any feedback and suggestion to improve the feature is appreciated.

		
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in Sku r34.1
	- Added waypoint layer infos to Stormwind, Elwynn and Westfall
	- Added a route to DM dungeon entrance, fixed the tower in Elwynn, and a bunch of other things
	- Fixed an issue that could lead to a "constant table overflow" error and losing all settings on closing the game with Alt + F4
	- Target outputs now should be in one line (irrelvant if you're not using nvda sapi)


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in Sku r34
	- Fixed the "available/accepted" text in npc greetings dialogs that questie was breaking with its latest release
	- Auto waypoint names changed
		All existing Auto waypoints have been renamed to make them distinguishable. The word "Auto" has been appended with the zone name and a sequence number. 
		New auto waypoint names (created by mappers from this update onwards) can also contain additional information. 
		Example: "auto inside first floor lions inn goldshire elwyn 83". 
		However, the naming of the auto waypoints is up to the mapper. 
		We will try to add more information to new waypoints where this is appropriate. 
		Not on all waypoints. (That is too much work and it would provide no value).
	- New: waypoint layers
		Waypoints can now have layer numbers.
		Layer numbers need to be manually assigned by the mapper. By default, they are neither there for existing waypoints nor for new waypoints.
		The layer number or just "layer" of a waypoint indicates its elevation. 
		"Layer 0" means that this waypoint is at the default level. This usually is the ground level/floor.
		"Layer 1" is one level above the ground level. And "Layer minus 1" is one level below ground level.
		So in the inn, the ground floor would be "Layer 0", the basement would be "Layer minus 1" and stairs up would be "Layer 1".
		The layer numbers are not real height information in the world. They only represent "logical waypoint levels".
		They are not meant to show you how high up in meters you are. They are meant to show you which waypoints are on the same layer. At places where several waypoints or routes are on top of each other.
		So, for example, if you are in the basement of the inn, you should find an entry point with "layer -1" upon starting a route in order to get a working route.
		The layer numbers are pronounced to you at several points:
		- In route and quest navigation before waypoints as abbreviations: Examples: "L 0" stands for "layer 0", "L minus 1" stands for "layer minus 1", etc.
		- When you target an NPC or mob, the layer number is appended to the end of the name.
		Unfortunately, for technical reasons, the addon can only determine the precise layer number for unique names (names that only exist once). This is the case with all navigation lists (route, close route, quest destinations, etc.), but not with NPCs/mobs in the world that you are targeting.
		If the name of your target is there several times (for example, a guard in Dalaran), the addon tries to find the matching NPC/mob. However, this can be inaccurate.
		If this is the case, there is a "U" after the layer number. For "uncertain". Example: "L 0 U". This means that you should take the layer number with a certain amount of scepticism. :)
		We will assign layer numbers only at places where several waypoints/routes can overlap. Examples: Buildings with several floor, mines and caves where there are also routes above on the ground level, towers with several floors, etc.
		If a waypoint has no layer information, then nothing is pronounced.
		Therefore, no layer information before a waypoint does _not_ mean that it is on the default layer (0), but that the waypoint simply has no layer information.
		If the waypoint had layer information and was on the standard layer, then there explicit "L 0" would be pronounced.
		We will try to add layers to the existing waypoints/routes where this is necessary (buildings, caves, etc.).


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in Sku r33.25
	- There are some important changes for route entry points (see below). They are in preparation for an upcoming update, where I will rename auto points to something more usefull than just "auto". If don't know what an entry point is: it's the first point that is shown on shift + f10. If you still don't know what that means, then I _strongly_ suggest to read https://github.com/Duugu/Sku/wiki/How-To-Navigation#how-do-i-navigate-using-waypoints-routes-and-close-routes
	- Route navigation (shift + f10) is now showing a list of up to 10 entry points (sorted by range) instead of just a single entry point (the closest). So, on shift + f10, if you are unsure if you could start a route from there, go down and check other entry points in range, that could make a better starting point for your route.
	- The quest navigation menus (Start, Targets, End) now too have an Entry point list under Routes and Close Routes. (Instead of just silently taking the closest entry point.) Therefore you won't find the destinations directly under Routes/Close Routes anymore, but instead a list of entry points in between. Just like with shift + 10. Choose an appropiate entry point from the list, then go right, and there is the destination waypoints list. 
	- Available quests will now start announcing 60 seconds after login and not immediately after login
	- Fixed a bug with filters in Aura > Manage > Active
	- Made the menu for editing exiting auras outputs filterable


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in Sku r33.24
	- added some new aura output sounds (you need to download the updated audiodata, either SkuAudioData_en r9 ENGLISH or SkuAudioData r38 GERMAN, to use them). New sounds are: axe 01, blaze 01, interface 01 - 06, shot 01, sword 01 - 03, Tutorial Close 01, Tutorial Open 01, Tutorial Success 01


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in Sku r33.23

	- Implemented an internal translation feature for tutorials


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in Sku r33.22
	- Fixed a bug with creating a new step


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	- Linking of tutorial steps implemented
	- "There could be tutorials" hint on first login temporary disabled, as there are not tutorials yet. We are still in development for that feature.

	- Repaired the tutorial trigger "menu item"


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in Sku r33.12
	- Added a new tutorial trigger type: Menu item. 
		Creating a new trigger with that type will not instantly create the trigger. Instead it will wait for you to choose the required menu item from the real sku menu.
		To choose the required menu item get to that menu item. Then use /sku menuselect. The addon will create the new trigger and get you back to the Tiggers menu of your tutorial step.
		The trigger will have a name like "Menu item: 1,2,1,1,6". The the menu item numbers. 1,2,1,1,6 means first item in menu root (Navigation), second item under Navigation (Waypoint), first item under Waypoint (Select), and so on.
		If you need to check what actual menu path the numbers are, then there is a "Resolve" menu option under each "Menu item" trigger.

	- Changed the fall detection and output. The addon will now default make a rising sound as soon as you start falling. Even if it only is like falling down a step. The sound will start small and get higher fast. There are new settings under Core > Options > Fall detection settings. They are pretty self explaining. To set up the old behavior (voice and delay of 1 sec), set Sound output to off and Delay to 1000.

	- Emilylorange mapped routes, graveyards, and about 1/2 the existing quests in Azshara, and parts of Blasted Lands.
	- Fixed some bugs with the dialog-key replacement (space to auto/complete accept quests, etc.). It is now selecting current quests only if the quest objectives are actually completed and ready to finish. Additionally the feature now should work with all quest windows.
	- Fixed a bug with quest notifications where setting Available Quests > Enabled to Off also was disabling notifications for Current Quests.
	- Removed "Ignore quests x levels below your level" for option current quests notifications, as that wasn't making much sense.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in Sku r32.16
	- Fixed a bug with quest notification for completed quests that was breaking the feature.
	- Fixed a bug with the auction house that was leading to an empty Auctions from full scan list.
	- Fixed a bug with Monitor > Player > Health continous output that was unintentionally outputting 1 if the player was dead.
	- Added a new soft targeting setting for enemies: Options > Options > Soft Targeting > Enemy > Mute Names in Combat. Default: Off. With On the addon will not output enemy names for soft targets in combat. This setting is to avoid audio clutter in fights with a lot of enemies.
	- Fixed a bug with the BIS Show your class only setting.
	- Fixed a bug with BIS details in loot roll tooltips.
	- Added BIS details to char equipment tooltips.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in Sku r32.15
	- Added best in slot lists for max level chars per class and spec under Core > Best In Slot > Lists. As default the addon only shows lists for your current class. Go to Core > Best In Slot > Options to change that. First item in lists is BIS. Second is second best, etc. The loot roll tooltip has a new section named "BIS info" with BIS details for the item (if that item is on any BIS lists).


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in Sku r32.14
	- Tried to fix the bug with not working "contains" auras. Again.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in Sku r32.13
	- Fixed a bug with the four new "... duration" aura attributes, that was breaking them and all conditions with the Contains operator. The new auras now should work, and existing aura shouldn't be triggered unintentionally anymore.
	- Fixed a bug with quest notifications that was causing errors.
	- Fixed a bug with friendlist that was causing errors.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in Sku r32.12
	- Added four new attributes for aura conditions: "Buff list target remaining duration", "Debuff list target remaining duration", "Your buff list remaining duration", "Your debuff list remaining duration". You can use them to evaluate the remaining duration of the buff/debuff from the "buff/debuff list (L) contains" conditions for you/your target. They have no effect if there isn't the appropiate "buff/debuff list (L) contains" condition in your aura.
	- Added a Core > AtlasLoot > Loot history menu with all blue (rare) or better items you've looted. As the addon explicit needs to record looted items, the list of course only has items that you've looted from now on.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in Sku r32.11
	- Added a "Buy" menu option (additionally to Left click and Right click) for items at vendors to buy stacks. If you're buying more than 20 items the addon needs to buy them in steps of 20 every 0.25 seconds. That may take a while with lager stacks. The addon plays the auction house scan progress sound on every bought stack of 20 items.
	- Fixed the missing translations for beacon types in quest notifications settings.
	- Fixed a bug that was still printing available quests to chat if quest notifications were disabled.
	- Removed "level unknown" output for objects on interact soft targeting with sku tts.
	- Auction house filters are now working for auctions from full scan too.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in Sku r32.10
	- Disabled quest notifications while you are on taxi via a flight master.
	- Fixed a bug with quest notifications distance that is printed to the chat.
	- Fixed a bug with quest notification for some daily quests that don't have a level.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in Sku r32.9
	- New: Quest notifications, under Quests > Options > Quest notifications. (default: off)
		Quest notifications are auto anouncing quests nearby you that are available to accept or ready for hand in.
		The idea is, to not only "play the list of available quests", but instead realize that there are available quests around by just walking around and exploring the area.
		For that there are audio beacons added to the quest givers with available quest / quests to turn in and the addon is printing the quest in chat.
		I tried to design the beacons as conservative as possible, as in some areas could be several available quests at one place, and therefore serveral simultanous beacons.
		As default the beacons at 50 volume of usual beacons, and they are only active in 180 degrees in front of you. The maximum range for available quests is 30 meters. The maximum range for quests to hand in is 60 meters.
		That should keep the audio clutter in areas with many quests low. If you still uncomforable with the beacons, there are a lot of options to change their appearance under Quests > Options > Quest notifications. Separately for available quests and completed quests. The options should be pretty self explaining.
		So, as stated, for now the feature is disabled for both types as default. Get to Quests > Options > Quest notifications, enable it, adjust the settings if required, and please provide feedback if the feature provides any value and/or what should be changed.
	- New: AtlasLoot favorites. Added favorites lists for all slot types (head, feet, weapon, etc.) under Core > Atlasloot. Every item in Atlasloot lists has a "Add to favorites" sub menu entry, to add the item to the favorites list. All favorites lists can have a unlimited number of items. They are numbered. The number is the priority for the item. You can move items up and down in the priority lists. The item priority in a list is are just fyi. For organisation. The addon will let you know if you are rolling on an item that is in your favorite list ("item xy, prio x in atlasloot...")
	- Added the currently worn item to vendor item tooltips.
	- Fixed a bug with posting auctions in the auction house. The addon was ignoring the duration parameter and posting all auctions with 24 hours. It now should correctly post auctions for 12, 24, or 48 hours.
	- Fixed a bug with the pet section on the overview pages, that was blocking all sections below the Pet section if there was no pet (for example the Cooldowns section with default settings).
	- Fixed a bug with sending a new mail that was leading to a fatality sound. Bug had no negative effects, though.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in Sku r32.8
	Next try to fix the Interact Soft targeting:
	I have fixed some code that sometimes was missing target changes and was outputting incorrect "enabled/disabled" messages to chat in some scenarios. That should have fixed the interact soft targeting issues.
	Additionally I've renamed the global soft targeting option "Do soft targeting if" to "Do interact soft targeting if" to make clear that it is just about interact and not for enemy and friends. 
	Important: as it turned out some of you are not aware of the "Do interact soft targeting if" option or its impact, and therefore by mistake assuming that interact soft targeting unintended was disabled.
	That is not the case. If you have the "Do interact soft targeting if" setting set to "No hard target locked" (that is the default), then interact soft targeting will be paused as long as you are hard targeting something (by pressing tab or control tab).
	That is intended. You wouldn't be able to use G for enemies without having interact soft targeting paused while hard targeting some unit.
	Therefore you need to clear your hard target (escape) to continue interact soft targeting.
	So, interact soft targeting not working while hard targeting something is no error. Interact soft targeting is not disabled in that case. It is just paused. There is no sense in pressing the Enable interact soft targeting key. It is enabled. Just paused. You just need to clear your hard target.
	As it sometimes is required to have a friendly hard target locked and still to do interact soft targeting (for example if you are /follow a player and still would like to find objects), I have added a third available option to the "Do interact soft targeting if" setting. That is "No attackable hard target locked" (from now on that is the default for new profiles). That one is pausing interact soft targeting only if you are hard targeting an _attackable_ unit.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in Sku r32.7
	- Emilylorange fixed a lot of map bugs in Northrend, mapped Ashenvale, partly mapped Azshara, and added alliance friendly mailboxes to Dalaran.
	- Tried to fix the issue where the soft targeting settings are sometimes not correctly applied. Unfortunately I have no clear idea when that happens. Apparently on some unkown combination of login/reload/teleport/targeting. But I can't find out, and therefore not test. Please report if it still happens. Thanks!
	- Editing an aura won't change the name of renamed auras auras anymore.
	- In editing an existing auras there is a new option "Auto generate aura name" to set renamed auras to the old auto-generated name that is build from the auras conditions.
	- Fixed bugs with buying items from the auction house.
	- Fixed a bug with auras containing the conditions Buff List Target, Debuff List Target, or Spell Name On Cooldown. With multiple auras containing those conditions only the first aura was triggered.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in Sku r32.6
	- Tried to enhance the loading times. Initial loading on login and reload is still the same, but changing zones (transition in / out of dungeons, taking portals, ships, etc.) should be a bit faster.
	- Added a new option "Rename" to each aura under Auras > Manage auras to edit the aura name (that is just build from the auras conditions by default).
	- Added options to ignore debuffs by name under Core > Monitor > Player and Party > Debuff. The menu with not ignored debuffs is slow. That is expected, as it has a massive list of all spells in the game. Not a bug! :)
	- Fixed a bug with the class trainer window, where not some not available skill could have been selected as default unless you manually selected any skill to train.
	- Resource scanning with ruRU locale should work now?


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in Sku r32.5
	- Fixed a typo that prevented the full addon from being loaded. Pardon. :D


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in Sku r32.4
	- Added DialogKey-like keys for quest and dialog windows. Space key in dialog windows (quest list, dialog options, flight master, innkeeper, etc.) will select the first active quest. If there isn't any active it will select the first available quest. If there isn't any available it will select the first gossip/dialog option. Space in quest dialogs will accept/complete/finish the quest (depending on what window is open). Number key 1 to 4 in the quest reward choice window will select the quest reward number x.
	- Added Russian translations for resource names (herbs, mining nodes, gas)


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in Sku r32.3
	- Fixed an issue with enabling/disabling the soft targeting categories via key binds or changing settings via the menu where settings were not applied correctly on login/reload.
	- Changed the maximum range for interact soft targeting from 18 to 15 meters, as it turned out that this is the maximum.
	- Fixed the "Do soft targeting if > No hard target locked" option (that is the default value) to ignore interact soft targets if you are targeting something. This should fix the issue where you could not attack hard targets using G if there was some interactable soft target (corpse, box, etc.) in front of you.
	- Fixed an issue where the addon was not playing the target sound/name for corpses on interact soft targeting
	- Added CTRL + SHIFT + N as the default key bind for Enable/disable Interact Soft Targeting. Only applies to new users or users who not already have bound a key for this.
	- Added the option "Chat notification on enabling/disabling soft targeting categories" to the overall soft targeting settings (default: on).
	- Fixed (hopefully) an issue with minimap scanning 
	- Again (hopefully) fixed another bug with minimap scanning and notifications on resources, that was leading to scans not working, resource notification not working, and a load of other strange things.
	- Removed a bunch of Ulduar maps from the database. Should fix the error spam in Ulduar raid.
	- Removed the Options > Options > Debug Options > Show error menu item, as there now is /sku errors, and this is the prefered way to show errors.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in Sku r32.2
	- Changed the default setting for "Options > Options > Soft targeting > Interact > Output sound for" from "Objects and lootable/skinnable and units" to "Objects and lootable/skinnable"
	- Fixed a bug with minimap scanning and notifications on resources	


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in Sku r32.1
	- Added AtlasLoot integration/accessibility. There is a new menu entry Core > Atlas Loot to access AtlasLoot database. You need to have AtlasLootClassic installed for that (https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/atlaslootclassic/download/4352422). All data is directly taken from the AtlasLoot addon. The Search submenu has just a long list of all items to filter for any specific item. The Lists submenu has the AtlasLoot categories, etc. Item Sets and Items have the usual Sku tooltips with more info (set item list, set bonus, dropped by, currently equipped, etc.). This is just the first implementation with raw access to the data. I will add more features like favorites, filters, etc. in a later step.
	- Fixed a bug with Core > Auction house > Sales > New Auction. Menu shouldn't show "Empty" anymore
	- Fixed a bug with the overview pages and some section that were cutting the page off (raid, pet)
	- Fixed a bug with hearthstone cooldown on overview page
	- Fixed a bug with the friends list that was cause a single error on login.
	- Fixed a bug with trainer windows, that was showing not available skills
	- Fixed a bug with role check buttons
	- Added settings to enable and configure soft targeting. Please read the whole description below. I know it is a lot of text. But it is important to understand the feature!
		Soft Targeting is a new way to automatically target items like enemies, players, NPCs and objects without scanning or pressing a button. With Soft Targeting, the game will automatically target anything that is in a certain area in front of you.
		Overview:
		In traditional targeting, you press TAB or CTRL + TAB to target something. This target is locked until you remove it with ESC or switch to another target with TAB. All your activities (spells, attacks, etc.) are performed on this locked target. This traditional target or targeting still exists. From now on, however, we no longer call it „target“ (or „targeting“) but „Hard Target“ or „Hard Targeting“ for better differentiation.
		Soft Targeting is an additional target or an additional way to target something. With the old Hard Target and the new Soft Target you can have two targets at the same time.
		You do not actively select the Soft Target via TAB. It is always automatically the next appropiate item in your line of sight. If Soft Targeting is enabled, the game permanently selects the next item in front of you as the Soft Target. The Hard Target, the one you select using TAB, remains unaffected. If you have not selected a Hard Target with TAB, all actions go to the automatically selected Soft Target. If you have explicitly selected a Hard Target, all actions go to this Hard Target as before.
		If Soft Targeting is activated, you can always make the automatically selected Soft Target become your Hard Target by pressing TAB (or CTRL + TAB for friends).
		So, there are now two "targets". The previous Hard Target that you select, and a dynamically changing Soft Target that the game automatically selects and changes.
		How it works:
		Soft Targeting is performed separately for enemies (mobs, hostile players), friends (NPCs, friendly players) and interaction items (quest items, herbs, mining nodes, portals, quest givers, etc. - simply everything you can interact with) and can be separately enabled and configured for all three categories. So, for example, you can enable it for enemies, disable it for friends and enable it for interaction items. By default, it is disabled for enemies and friends, and enabled for interaction items.
		You can enable and disable Soft Targeting via three new key bindings. These are not assigned by default. You will find them under Core > Sku key bindings. And you can enable/disable Soft Targeting via the menu under Options > Options > Soft Targeting. In this menu you will also find settings for the Soft Targeting categories (enemy, friend, interaction). The settings are mostly the same for all three. You can set a range in front of you in which the game selects Soft Targets (5, 15 or 180 degrees) and a max distance (enemy and friend up to 60 meters, interact up to 18 meters).
		Since the Soft Targets are selected automatically by the game without your intervention, the addon announces the Soft Target in the same way as the Hard Targets (that are explicitly selected by you), with name, level, etc., when the Soft Target is changing. In addition, it does play a short sound before each Soft Target output so that you can distinguish between the hard and soft target outputs.
		The settings in the menu are mostly to control when and how the game plays these outputs on new soft targets. You can disable the sound. Or use only the sound and disable the name. Or change the sound. Or have no announcement at all for certain Soft Targets. (For example, Friend Soft Targets have "Players" and "Pets" disabled by default. Otherwise you would have a lot of spam in crowded places with a lot of Soft Target changes). Just review the settings. 
		As there can now be two targets with (the Hard Target and the Soft Target), and there could be a lot of Soft Target changes, depending on the amount of items around you, there are also two new key bindings under Core > Sku Key Bindings to provide more overview. One to announce your current Hard Target again, and one to announce the current Soft Target again. Both are unassigned by default.
		There are also two general settings for Soft Targeting in the menu:
		- "Auto set hard target to soft target for". By default, the game does not automatically make a new Soft Target your Hard Target. With this option you can activate this for enemies or friends (not for both). Your Hard Target will automatically change with every Soft Target change. Unless you have locked a Hard Target by pressing TAB or CTRL + TAB. In this case, the Hard Target will no longer change automatically.
		- "No soft targeting if". As mentioned, as long as Soft Targeting is enabled, the game permanently selects the items in front of you as Soft Targets. Even if you have actively selected (locked) a Hard Target. If new/more items enter or leave the field of view, the Soft Target changes automatically. And the new Soft Target is announced. With this setting, this no longer happens as long as you have a locked Hard Target (i.e. you have actively pressed TAB or CTRL + TAB to hard target something).
		Additional information:
		- Important: If you exclude specific items (e.g. "units" in interaction, or „players“ in enemies), then Soft Targeting for these items will still be done by the game, and may block other Soft Targets. There is just no announcement of the Soft Target change anymore. That's all. Example: If you have enabled Soft Targeting for Interaction, the game automatically is soft targeting all interactable items. This could be a mailbox or a quest giver. If you are turning towards a mailbox, it becomes the Soft Target (because you can interact with it). However, if there is a quest giver in straight line between you and the mailbox, then the quest giver becomes the Soft Target (because you can interact with it too, and Soft Targeting always selects the closest matching item in line of sight). The quest giver therefore blocks the mailbox as a soft target. This happens _even_ if you have only selected "Objects and lootable/skinnable" for Interact and not "Objects and lootable/skinnable and _units_". This setting only applies to the outputs. Not to the actual selection of targets by the soft targeting feature.
		- You can interact with Interact Soft Targets as usual with the G key. Without having to take them to the Hard Target with TAB / CTRL+ TAB. However, this is not possible with enemies or friends Soft Targets. You have to take them to your Hard Target using TAB / CTRL + TAB.
		- As mentioned, Interact Soft Targeting applies not only to objects in the game world, but also to NPCs you can interact with in some way. Vendors, quest givers, guards (they have a dialogue), corpses (can be looted), etc.
		- When fishing, Interact Soft Targeting immediately will find the bobber (and you can press G without scanning). However, sometimes the the bobber will fly a little further than the maximum range of 18 meters for Interact Soft Targeting. In this case, Soft Targeting will not detect it. Just cast again until the bobber ends up within the 18 meters range.
		- All old scan features are still available. You usually just should don’t need them anymore.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in Sku r32
	- Updated the interface version to Ulduar patch.
	- Added support for resource scanning (mining, herbalism) for Chinese (Simplified).


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in Sku r31.41
	- Changes for Core > Monitor > Party > Health Pitch style:
		- Renamed "Silent on 100 and 0 percent" to "Continous silent on 100 and 0 percent", as it applies on continous outputs only and not on event outputs.
		- Added a new setting: Add sound on 100 percent. Default: Yes. Adds a very short pop sound to the number if the party member is at 100 percent health.
		- Added a new setting: Add Dead on 0 percent. Default: Yes. Adds the word Dead  to the number if the party member is at 0 percent health.
		- A triggered full output (via the "Trigger monitor party continous output" key bind) now ignores the Prio settings and outputs members ordered from 1-5.
		- Added a new slash command to enable/disable the party health monitor: /sku mon,party,health
		- Added a new slash command to print the auto-detected roles to chat: /sku mon,party,roles,print
		- Added a new slash command to reset the auto-detected roles: /sku mon,party,roles,reset


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in Sku r31.40
	- Added a new slash command: /sku errors. It is printing the last 5 errors as single lines to chat. (If Buggrabber and Bugsack are installed.)
	- Fixed an issue with Core > Action Bars > Totem Set 1-3 > Key Binding. Should work now.
	- Map updates
		- Added waypoints for Ulduar flight master and repair
		- Added a lot of Argent Tournament Grounds waypoints
		- Added a waypoint for ulduar meeting stone
	- Added the raid members list to the overview page(s) (see next bullet)
	- Added a second overview page. The second overview page is exactly working as the first one, except that you need to press SHIFT + UP instead of SHIFT + DOWN to open it. The idea is to split information on to pages, instead of having a long and growing list on a single page. As default the second page only shows the raid members, if you are in a raid. Get to Options > Options > Overview pages, to show/hide contents on the second or first page.
	- Jus, Kim and Kev got their overall voice volume raised by ~20%.
	- Renamed the "Blizzard whisper" chat type to "Battle net whisper"
	- Fixed a bug with auction house full scan data where the lowest buyout price was 0 copper
	- Added a aura log recorder to debug lag issues. Don't use it without being requested to do so. Enable with /sku record,start and disable with /sku record,stop. All data is cleared on login/reload.
	- Fixed a bug with missing outputs for some debuffs in Core > Monitor > Party > Debuffs. Should now work with all debuffs and debuff types.
	- Renamed "Core > Monitor > Party > Health" to "Health Chord Style"
	- Added a second experimental style to monitor the health of party members: "Core > Monitor > Party > Health Pitch style".
		This concept again is to lower the clutter and output spam to a level where you would be able to use it to monitor and heal even in raids of 10, 15 or even more members without being overloaded by the audio outputs. At the moment it is just for partys with 5 players. I will extend it to 10 player raids in the next step, if the concept turns out to be usefull.
		This party health output style is outputting numbers (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) in different pitch levels for party members.
		However, is it not speed up on low health like Audio QS. Instead it is outputting the party members number once on every event (damage or healing). Example: if party member 2 is taking damage (or is healed) it doing a single "2" output.
		Each number is recorded in 15 different pitch levels. There is a very, very low pitched "2" and a very high pitched "2" (and 13 pitch levels in between). Very low means very high health. Very high means very low heals.
		So, the output for party member 2 starts with a very low "2" at 100% and gets higher and higher every time the party member 2 is taking damage. 
		That way there is less audio spam, as the addon has not to constantly repeat the unit number, but you are still able to get the current health from the outputs pitch level if something happens.
		To conclude: The outputs are not continously, as with Audio QS. Instead they are event based. There is (or can be, depending on your setting) a single output on every event (unit is getting damage or is being healed). If nothing happens, a unit taking damage or heal, there is no output for that unit.
		There are several settings to control/restrict the output, to minimize the amount of outputs to what you actually need to know, avoiding clutter from stuff that isn't important.
		Most of those setting are per role (tank, heal, damager). That way are able to set different values per role. Example: Output on every event for tanks, only on +/- 5% health change for healers, and only on +/- 20% heal change for damagers.
		The addon is auto detecting the role of each party member. It is using a combination of amount of damage taken in all previous fights and overall max health for each member. 
		As there is no damage if you just joined a party, there will be no role assigned during the first few fights. If the addon "learns" more, it will start to assign roles to party members.
		The auto role assignment may not be 100% accurate at all times. (For example if there boosting groups and players with much higher levels and therefore much more health than the tank. Or of some non-tank party member is taking massive amounts of damage. Or if there just isn't enough data from fights.) Your can alternatively use the Role assignment option to manually assign fixed roles to the party members.
		Additionally to the single party member number output on each event (damage or heal) you can set up a continous output starting at a specific health percentage at a specific rate. Example: You can set up the pitched number output starting from 50% or less health every 3 seconds.
		The "Continuous output start at" setting is role specific, and provides an option to set the percent health value to start the continous output from.
		The "Continuous output every seconds" settings is for all roles, and just is the amount of seconds between the continuous outputs.
		The "Event output limitation" setting again is role specific. It is to limit the amount of events (damage/healing) with outputs. It provides two settings per role:
			- "minimum percent health difference since previous event": This is the minimum percentage of health change since the previous output. Example: if a unit has 100% health, and this is set to 15, then the first output will be at 85%, the second at 70%, and so on.
			- "minimum pitch steps difference since previous event": As mentioned, there are 15 different pitch levels (roughly every 6% health). This is the minimum pitch level change since the previous output. Example: If a unit has 100% health, and this is set to 2, then the first output will be at 88% (2 x 6 = 12), the next at 76%, and so on.
			The two event output setting need to be both true to have an output triggered. If percent health is set to 1% and pitch steps is set to 0, there would be an output on every 1% change (percent is >= 1, and step is >= 0). However, if pitch steps is set to 1, then there won't be any output if the pitch hasn't been changing by at least 1 step, no matter if the percent health has been changed by 1% or more.
			Both setting may sound similar, but they are not. Always consider both values, and what will happen if you are changing them.
		The "Prio output" setting is role specific. It controls if outputs for roles are priorized. Usually outputs will happen in the order they are occurring. If the damager is hitted first, and then the tank, the addon will ouput the damagers number and than the tanks number. If you set Prio Output for some role to Yes, then those outputs are always placed at the first position of the output queue.
		The "Percent delay for next output in queue" setting is for all roles. It controls how "fast" the addon is outputting numbers if there is more than one output in the queue (for example if all party members are taking aoe damage at the same time). The addon tries to not overlap the outputs. There is a delay of 0.2 seconds after each output before the next number is outputted. That is 100%. If you lower this setting the next number will be outputted early. The outputs can start overlapping at ~80%. 
		As usual you are always party member 1. The party leader is always party member 2 (except if your are the leader, of course). Therefore it could be a great idea to make the tank the party leader. That way you always have the tank as party member 2.
		As stated, the outputs are event based. If nothing happens, there is no output. But sometimes it can be helpful to have a quick overview of the partys health, even if nothing happens. Therefore there is a new Sku key bind for this feature, Trigger monitor party continous output, that is not bound as default. Bind it, to trigger a single full party health output on request at any time.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
Changes in Sku r31.39
	- Removed not longer required map files. Should have reduced the download size and the required time for extracting the .zip file a lot.
	- Sku now is auto-hiding the Details News window on first login and the default details panel for alts.
	- Added a dispell / debuff monitor under Core > Monitor > Player / Party > Debuffs. Default: disabled.
		It is basically working as Health, Mana, etc. and is announcing dispellable debuffs for you and/or group members.
		No debuffs types are enabled as default. You explicit need to select the debuff types that you would like to monitor. (Magic, Diseases, Poison, Curse)
		There is only a single output if a debuff of some type is applied, renewed, or if the stack number changes. No continous output as default. Use "Continuous output starts after seconds" to have a continous output started if the debuff type wasn't removed after x seconds.
		The default output for Player is the full word (Magic, Disease, Poison, Curse).
		The default output for Party is just the first character (M for Magic, D for Disease, P for Poison, C for Curse) and the party members number. Example: D3 means, party member 3 has some disease debuff. There is on option to switch to full words instead of just the first character.
		For Party you are always party member 1. Other party members are 2 to 5
		I did a lot of test for the debuff / dispell monitor feature, but it is of course difficult to test. Even more for parties. Please test and provide feedback / report errors
	- Added a health monitor for your pet under Core > Monitor > Pet > Health
	- Added a new voice for monitor outputs: Kevin
	- Changed monitor voice Kimberly a little bit, to better distinguish from Justin
	- Changed the output for 100% from "full" to "10"
	- Added slash commands for monitors to switch them on/off:
		/sku mon player health
		/sku mon player power
		/sku mon player debuffs
		/sku mon pet health
		/sku mon party debuffs


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
Changes in Sku r31.38
	- Removed empty (silent) lines from tooltips.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
Changes in Sku r31.37
	- Added a new submenu Options > Options > Overview page sections to set up what sections in what order are shown on the overview page (Shift + Down). Get to the sections submenu, there are options to move each section up/down or hide/show.
	- Removed an overlooked debug output on login


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
Changes in Sku r31.36

		- Please test. I will add more stuff later.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
Changes in Sku r31.35
	- Fixed the broken engineer auction house in Dalaran.
	- Added a new option to Core > Monitor > Player > Health/Power: "Continuous output start at". Possible values are "Never" and 0-10. The default is never. The continuous output starts if the health/mana is equal/below the value. The old "Continuous output" Yes/No option was removed, as it is not longer required with this change. If you had "Continuous output" enabled, you need to set up that again via the new "Continuous output start at".
	- Added a new section "Cooldowns" to the bottom of the overview page with all spells from your spellbook that are currently on cooldown and their remaining cooldown.

	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
Changes in Sku r31.34
	- Added Shaman totem sets to Core > Action bars. There are 3 sets, with 4 totem buttons each.
	- Added the set number to all totem button key bindings under Core > Game Key Binds, for clearification.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
Changes in Sku r31.33
	- Added Core > Monitor > Player > Power to monitor your power ressource (Mana, Rage, Energy, Runic Power). Works the same way as Player > Health, except there is an option to choose the power/resource type. The default is your main resource. Default voice is Kimberly. To avoid extensive audio clutter the addon tries to speak both, continuous health and power at the same time, if both are enabled. That of course only works if the "Continuous output every seconds" setting for both is the same or a multiple. (hp 3 secs / power 3 secs, 3 / 6, 3 / 9, etc.)
	- Added an "Event Steps" setting to Core > Monitor > Player > Health and Power. That is the number of steps on from 0 to 100 the addon is announcing values. 10 means every 10 percent, 5 means every 20 percent, 2 means every 50 percent. The default value for Health is 10, the default for Power is 5.
	- Added a new experimental feature to monitor the health of party members: Core > Monitor > Party > Health
		This is just a first test on an idea for an audio concept. Not a final feature. I would appreciate feedback if the concept provides any value and if it is worth or not to put more work into it.
		The feature is constantly outputting the health of all 5 party members by playing 5 fast beep sounds in different pitches. The first beep stands for party member 1, the second beep for party member two, and so on. The last beep (the fifth in a full party) is you. If there are less than 5 party members you are always the last one.
		The pitch of each beep indicates the health of the specific party member. Very low pitch means 100% health. Very high pitch means very low health. Reverted sound with very high pitch means dead / 0% health. There are 8 different pitch levels from 0 to 100 percent health.
		Example: low, low, low, high, low means, party member 1, 2, 3 are at 100% health. party member 4 is at low health, party member 5 (you) is at 100% health.
		As default the monitor starts if at least one party member is below 100% health and stops of everyone is at 100%.
		The feature is off by default. There are options to enable it and more under Core > Monitor > Party > Health.
		Remember: This is a test to evaluate different concepts for party (and probably raid) health status. Please provide feedback on the value of this specific concept. Suggestion on enhancements or changes, or even different concepts, are more than welcome.
		The idea is to have a more constant, less cluttered/annoying, and more intuitive output than the one, one, one, etc. from Audio QS.
		I would assume that, if one gets used to the output style, the output speed could be much faster (if you would like to try, lower the "Speed" option to 20, the default is 50).
		I could add more options, like volume settings, and an "event" setting where the output isn't continously but event based (if party health actually changes), as with the player > health outputs, and more.

	- Lil Kimberly and Justin are there to monitor your health.
		- There is a new feature under Core > Monitor to monitor different values. Right now there only is Player > Health. There could be more in future.
		- Core > Monitor > Player > Health is to output your current health. It is mainly intended for raid scenarios, where AudioQs isn't that useful. It is disabled as default.
		- There are two output volumes (Continuous, Event) that are adjustable from 10% to 100%.
		- The feature is continuously outputting your health from 0 to 9 using the "Continuous" volume, where 0 means 0% and 9 means 90% health. 100% health is announced as "full". If you health actually changes it is outputting your new health using the "Event" volume. The default value for "Continuous" is 50%, the default for "Event" is 80%.
		- There are some more settings, like the voice, only in dungeons/raids, etc.
		- All settings are saved per character.
		- The slash command to enable/disable the feature is "/sku mon,health"

		- Reverb: Enables reverb in certain areas that have reverb zones such as some indoors, underwater, etc.

	- Added gas resources to Core > Options > resource scanning.
	- There is a new experimental feature: notify on resources (mining nodes, herbs). If you are moving the feature is permanently scanning for resource that are popping up on the minimap. You are notified If there are new resources, and can then to the usual resource scan to get it.

	- Outlands - Blade's Edge Mountains map data added, mapped by Lironah and Emilylorange
	- The auction house history data is back. :) There _should_ be no more risk for errors with lost settings/auras/etc. However, it is a complex topic, and I would suggest to backup your WTF folder before using this update. Just to be on the safe side. Even if it shouldn't be required. :)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	General
		- Action bar names under Core > Actions bars renamed to be more consistent with the names under Core > Game key bindings.

	Maps
		- Northrend Icecrown mapped
		- Slightly changed the waypoints and added a rescue point in the deeprun tram to make riding the tram easier.

	Mail
		- Quest items and soulbound items in Mail > New letter > Items are filtered out.
		- Bug with stuck in endless loop with Mail > Open all while bags are full fixed.

	Auction house
		The full auction house feature was updated. The "processing" sound has been changed. An additional sound for "processing completed" has been added.
		The general speed has not been changed. That is not possible. Blizzard is throtteling addons on querying the auction house. That throtteling is dynamic. It depends on the number of players on the server, on the auction house workload and more. The same query can take 5 seconds or 25 seconds. That is expected and no error. It is dynamic and depends on the current workload!
		The required time for queries also depends on the amount of auctions (and therefore on the server population, as high pop servers will have much more auctions than low pop servers).
		The more auctions a query is returning, the longer the query takes. Querying all auctions from "Trade goods" with tens of thousands of auctions swill of course take much more time than querying the "Shields" category with just a few auctions.
		To overcome this there are new menus to show, find and filter auctions. Those will speed up the process for most items/queries by just using more specific queries.
		The auctions menu still has 3 main menus: Auctions, Bids, and Sales. 
		Bids (auctions that you have bid on) and Sales (auctions you have posted) are unchanged. The are working as before. The Auctions menu has been changed. It now has 5 entries: 
		- Filter and sort (unchanged): 
			To filter the queried auctions in the lists below.
		- Auctions by item: 
			this menu is to query the auction house for a specific item that you are interested in (faster than querying all items from a category).
			This contains all auction house categories and a fixed list of all items of each category. 
			The items list in each category is NOT what is in the auction house. It is just a fixed list of all items in that category from the items database. You need to go into the submenu of an item to see the actual running auctions for that item.
			The first menu entry "all" is listing all auctions from that category (as before).
			On selecting an item the addon will output the number of actual auctions for each item in that list. That may take a few seconds.
		- Auctions by seach string: 
			this menu is querying the auction house for some search term of your choice. Select "enter search string", type in the search term, and wait. Go down if the search is completed, to see the returned auctions. Repeat to search for something else.
		- Auctions from full scan: 
			This menu contains all auction house categories and all auctions in each category from the last full scan (see next bullet point below).
			As the data is from a full scan, the menu is extremly fast and there are no queries. You don't need to wait.
			However, as the data is from the last full scan, the auctions in this menu could be quite outdated. That depends on when you did the last full scan. Keep that in mind, if you are using the menu. If you want up to date data, do a full scan first.
			If you haven't done a full scan since login, the menu is empty. In that case, start a full scan first.
		- Start full scan: 
			This is starting a full auction house scan. A full scan is getting all auctions at once. Therefore the full scan can take a few seconds or several minutes. That totally depends on the server population, the number of auctions, the workload, etc. If the full scan is running, just wait for it to be completed. Do not do other stuff or try to check auction house categories.
			A full scan can be done once once in 15 minutes. If you are trying to do it earlier, it will fail.
			Logging out to the character selection screen and back in with the character will reset the 15 minutes timer. 
		Price data in item tooltips:
			The recent item price data is from the last full scan. If you haven't done a full scan in the current session, then there is no recent price data. The recent item price data is cleared on logout/reload.
			The history item price data is from all previous full scans. Every full scan data is added to the history data (up to 500 auctions per item). The history data is saved between game sessions/reloads.

		- TOGGLE LFG WINDOW
		- TOGGLE LFG LISTING TAB
		- TOGGLE LFG BROWSE TAB
		- TOGGLE ACHIEVEMENT WINDOW
		- TOGGLE STATISTICS WINDOW
		Under the new category: vehicle control
		- VEHICLE EXIT
		- VEHICLE PREV SEAT
		- VEHICLE NEXT SEAT
		- VEHICLE AIM UP
		- VEHICLE AIM DOWN
		- VEHICLE AIM INCREMENT
		- VEHICLE AIM DECREMENT
	- New feature: the LFG tool is accessible
		The LFG tool is a very complex feature. I did a bunch of test, but of course not in every situation.
		Please carefully test every possible scenario. Solo, in parties, as a leader, as a party member, etc. If possible do that with assistance of a sighted player, to check if everything is working as intended!
		Usage:
		The LFG window is bound to the key I as default. As that key is used by the sku addon for the "turn to beacon" feature, you need to bind the LFG windows to a new key to use it. There is a new binding named "TOGGLE LFG WINDOW" (under Core > Game key binds > assign key > interface). 
		To enlist yourself (if not in a party) or the full party (as a leader):
			- open the LFG window
			- go to "Enlist" and select your role(s)
			- go down and select a category for your post (dungeons, raids, Quest & zones, PvP, Custom)
			- go down and select actions from that category. Cou can check/uncheck as much categories as you want. You need to select at least one activity.
			- go down and enter a commen for your post (option, except for category "custom"). Caution: you need to exit the comment enter mode with Escape. Not with Enter!
			- Go down and select "List self" or "List group" if you are in a party
			Your LFG request will be listed. There will be a addon error. That seems to be a bug in the Blizzard interface. Please just ignore that.
		To browse the list of available LFG posts:
			- go to browse
			- go down and select a category
			- (Option) select the activities you are interested in. If you don'T select activities the list will contain all activities from the selected category (for example all dungeons in the world).
			- go down to "results", go right and down to see the list of found LFG requests. If there is only one entry "Refresh list", then the list is empty. Select another category with more LFG posts (dungeons should be quite busy). Each result entry has a tooltip with more details.
			- Go right on any result entry and do a left click to open the context menu and select actions for that entry (Request invite, Whisper party leader, etc.)
	- The Local menu now shows options on the LFG role poll popup.
	- Added all spells from Wrath to the spell database. That should fix issues with auras using new spells.
	- Auras using "own resource" are now covering death knights rune power too.
	- Menu items like bag slots, talents, etc. are dynamically updated on changes like left/right click, split, destroy, etc.
	- Fixed the role selection in the talent menu.
	- Added a new option "Chat > Options > Never reset audio queues". Default: Off. Don't enable it if you don't know what it means.
	- Fixed a bug with item rating for death knights that was blocking item tooltips. Now there are just no ratings for this class. :)
	- Fixed an issue that was occuring on reload.
	- Fixed a bug where Core > Action bars failed to show bars/button if the player was controling a pet or vehicle and the main action bar was replaced by the pet/vehicle bar.
	- New feature: special tasks
		This feature is guiding you in tasks/quest/scenarios where no coordinates and therefore waypoints and routes available.
		An example is one of the very first death knight quests, "Death comes from above", in the death knight starting area.
		The feature automatically detects those scenarios and is starting the correspondant special task. It then is providing instructions via voice. All instructions are added to the chat too, if you need to re-check them.
		The feature is telling you how much you need to turn left and right and move forward.
		You need to exactly follow the instructions. If the feature says "do not use any other keys except left, right and forward", then do not use any other keys until the task is completed or canceled. Under no circumstances. The feature will break if you are using other movement keys (like backward, strafe, autorun, etc.).
		The feature will output your direction and forward movement every time you are stopping turning/movement.
		For the example quest "Death comes from above" in the death knight starting area, the special task will start if you are entering the orb, and getting control over the orb (will take a few seconds, just wait).
		The first step will be to turn to 144 degrees. Use left/right to turn exactly (+/- 2 degrees) to turn to 144. DO NOT MOVE. Only turn. On turn steps do not use any other keys than left and right.
		If you have hit 114 the feature detects that an moves to step 2. That will be to move forward from 3.4 to 0. 3.4 is the overall time you need to press the forward key in seconds. You can do that in small incremental steps. Press forward very short. The number will decrease. Do that again, and again, until the number is 0. Do not move further than 0. Caution! You need to hit 0 EXACTLY, or the feature will break! Do not move further. No even 0.1 seconds. On move forward steps do not use any other keys than Forward. Not backward, not left/right, not strafe... nothing. just forward.
		If you reach 0 the feature will move to step 3 and will provide the relevant instructions on what to do. Step 3 will be a turning step again. Proceede as above.
		Just complete all steps, and the quest should be done.
		Remember: do not use any other keys than the key or keys that are valid for the current step while on a special task. If the step is turning, use turn left/right only. If the step is moving forward, use moving forward only. If you use other keys, the feature will break. You would have to abort the quest and start over.

Changes in Sku r30.11
	- Random enchantments items in bags are shown with the actual enchantment again.
	- Fixed the auction house sell bug. Selling is working again. But still only one auction per use. Need more time to fix it.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
Changes in Sku r30.10

	- Fixed an issue with the The dark Portal area in Blasted lands, winterspring and a bunch of other zones. Please keep reporting broken zones/areas.
	- Removed "Navigation > Waypoint > New.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
Changes in Sku r30.9

	- The character menu shows the Stats tab
	- The character menu shows Currencies/tokens tab
	- Added a sixth scan type: "360 10 very fast". It scans 360 degrees 0-10 meters in 2 seconds max. 
		Because it is faster, it is also more inaccurate. It is good on detecting larger objects that are close to you. Results are getting words the smaller and the more far away object are.
		Go to "Core > Scan settings > [one of the 8 pre-defined scans] > type" and select the new type "360 10 very fast"" for that scan.
	- Added a new option "Core > Options > do not hide game tooltip" (default: off)
		For players with some level of sight. As default the addon is hiding the visual tooltip instantly. That is speeding up the scan feature.
		If you have some sight and would like to read the visual tooltip, set this to on, to keep the visual tooltip.
	- The addon now should load a bit faster.
	- Again tried to fix the "table constants overflow" issue that leads to losing all sku settings.
	- Core > Options > "Auto following" and "Temporarily stop following upon casting" have been removed and won't work any longer.
		Blizzard has intentionally removed the option to start/stop following for addons. (https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/re-addons-still-able-to-execute-remote-follow-commands/1298614)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
Changes in Sku r28.8b

	- Re-added the unintentionally removed option "Announce friendly and hostile players".

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
Changes in Sku r28.8a
	
	Options
		- Clearing the audio queue of the Blizzard tts or the Sku tts was unintentionally clearing the queue for both. That is fixed. Blizzard and sku tts should now play in parallel and not skip each others outputs. One effect is, that weypoint comments do work again.
		- Removed the cut-off of long menu entries with ... in audio menus. The audio menu now always reads the full text line. There's are no more ...

	Mob
		- New option "generic outputs for player controled units via Sku" under Mob > Options. (Default: off) With this option outputs on targeting players or player controled units are done via the sku tts, using generic texts like "friendly player".


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
Changes in Sku r28.7
	
	Chat
		- Fixed a bug that caused messages to show twice in the chat.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
Changes in Sku r28.6

	Navigation
		- Fixed a bug with numpad 9 / i not working with some addons that are modifying the chat input box.

	Options
		- The menu now mandatory uses the Blizzard TTS. It is not possible to get back Sku TTS for the menu. The option to set Blizzard tts for the menu to on/off under Options > Options was removed.

	Chat
		- The chat module now is already using the new chat system from the Wrath version of the Sku addon.
			How to use the new chat
			The chat and all features described below are now usable in combat.
			The chat now has all chat messages sorted in tabs. That way you can create different tabs for different chat content and get more overview.
			As default there is only one chat tab named "Standard", with all chat messages. You could for example create a second chat tab, named "Party and Raid", with only that chat it.
			The chat still opens with Shift + F2.
			On Shift + F2 the addon first reads the name of the current tab and then the first (newest) chat line.
			You can use arrow down/up to move to the next/previous chat line.
			If you have more tabs then just Default (you need to create them), you can use arrow Right and Left to switch to those other tabs. Then just use Down/Up to read the chat lines in that tab.
			Chat tabs
				To see all current tabs go to Chat > Tabs. If you haven't created additional tabs, then the only tab there is "Default".
				You can create additional tabs using the New Tab menu under Chat > Tabs.
			Message types for tabs
				Every tab has its own settings for what messages should be shown in that specific tab.
				Go to Chat > Tabs > Default > Message Types to see what message types are shown in this tab.
				The categories like Combat, PvP, Other, etc. and the different chat types under those categories are the same that the blizzard interface is using.
				Every chat typ can have a specific action assigned. "Text" means, that the message type is shown in the specific tab. "Audio" means, the tab shows the message type, AND the messages are read out loud. And "Silent" means, that chat tab is not showning those messages, and they are not read out.
				Just browse the categories and message types of the Default chat tab, and set them to actions that you find appropiate.
			Chat channels for tabs
				The same system is there for all chat channels you've joined.
				Go to Chat > Tabs > Default > Channels and see what channels have what action for this tab.
			Whispers
				There are a bunch of new settings for the chat under Chat > Options > Chat settings.
				One of those is "Show whispers in new tab", which is On as default.
				Every whisper that your are receiving (or you are sending) will be shown in a new tab with this setting.
				So, if you do receive a whisper from Palabob, then that whisper (and the full following conversation, if there is any) is not shown in your "Default" tab, but in a new tab with the name of that player.
				Turn "Show whispers in new tab" off, to have all whispers in the default tab inline, instead in new tabs.
			Line context menu
				Every chat line in every tab has a new audio context menu with actions.
				To open the line context menu press Shift + Enter. Then use arrow Down/up as usual, to browse the options. To select/use an option, press Shift + Enter on that option. To leave the line context menu and get back to the chat lines use arrow left.
				Some context menu options are:
					- send message to channel
					- whisper sender
					- invite sender
					- copy sender name
					- copy this chat line
					- copy all chat lines
					- add sender to friend list
					- ignore sender
				Not all of them are always availabe. Example: "Ignore sender" isn't available for System chat messages. :D
			History
				And finally, the chat history for all tabs is saved between sessions. There are up to 100 old messages in each tab.

Changes in Sku r28.5
	Auras
		- Fixed an issue with combo points.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
Changes in Sku r28.4
	Core
		- Fixed the German text in socketing menu.
		- Fixed the enchanting menu. Should now work again.
		- Fixed the Popup menu. Example: yes/no on warning for enchanting an already enchanted item. Should now work as intended, without anything blocked. Even with the "Do you want to allow custom scrips..." thing and such stuff should work. But it is untested.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
Changes in Sku r28.3
	Core
		- Manually rebuilded the Socketing menu.
		- Fixed a bug with the trainer frame for weapon masters.
	
	Options
		- Fixed and issue with bank bags.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
Changes in Sku r28.2
	Navigation
		- The addon now plays a continous low volume warning sound (ping & purr) if routes on the minimap and/or the additional sku mimimap are (unintentionally) enabled. 
			The current default key binds for those features are Alt + K and Alt + L. Both features are only used for mapping and do generate a lot of lag, leading to bad gameplay.
			If you hear the constant ping in the background, then please use Alt + K and/or Alt + L to disable them.
			If Alt + K/L isn't working, the features are probably bound to other keys. Go to Core > Sku key binds > Bind key > Open Sku minimap / Show routes on minimap, to check what keys they are bound to.

	Auras
		- Added a new attribute and output "Your combo points" to evaluate/output your combo points on the current target.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
Changes in Sku r28.1

	Core
		- Fixed an issue with the turn to beacon feature and very low (1024x768 or lower) and very high (4k) screen resolutions.
		- Fixed an issue with minimap ressource scanning (Control + Shift F/R) and mining nodes.
		- Fixed an issue with mouseover scaSkuAuctionConfirmEditBoxnning on herbs/mining nodes (control + U, control + shift + U).
		- All "xy mouse over" readouts are now read by the Blizzard TTS voice.
		- Fixed a very rare issue with the I key and some input boxes (for example mail recipient, subject, body), that was mixing up what you typed in the input box.
		- The class trainer menu now has scroll down/up options.
		- Manually re-builded the profession trainer menu. Should now appear and work like other menu (crafting, etc.)
		- Added the tooltip of the item that will be crafted to the selected skill in the profession menu.
		- Added an option to read all tooltips. Core > Options > Read all tooltips (default: off). That will read out every single thing your mouse is getting over. Could generate a lot of audio spam.

	Options
		- All option menus (xx > options) are now filterable.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
Changes in Sku r28

	ATTENTION:
		You will need the new script (wow_menu) version 2.11 for this release. You can't use older scripts with this Sku release.
		Thus downloading wow_menu r2.11 is mandatory.

	Options
		- Changed the default key bind for stopping the TTS output from Right Shift key to Control + V.
		- Added 11 new sounds to Options > Options > Background sound.
		- Fixed a bug with reseting the sku addon profiles (Options > Options > Profile > Reset).

	Navigation
		- Fixed a bug with routes via quest log or shift + f10 were the routes list was empty if the entry point was the same as the destination point.
		- New feature: auto turn towards the current beacon
			Note: You need to install and use the newest script version for this feature. Wow menu 2.11 or higher.
			You now can use the I key or Numpad 9 to automatically turn your character towards the current beacon. Both keys are fixed and can't be adjusted.
			Turning your character takes around 0.3 seconds on each use. 
			The feature isn't 100% accurate. It is possible, that the character sometimes isn't heading excactly at the beacon, but a few degrees left or right from the beacon. Repeatingly pressing the key could help.
			The feature heavily depends on your game frame rate. High frame rates will make it more accurate. With low frame rates it is getting less accurate.
			The feature can be used while you are moving and is spammable. You can move and constantly press I or Numpad9 to turn towards the current beacon every 0.3 seconds.
			That will work quite good if the beacons are not to close to each other or if you are moving slowly.
			Spamming it while moving can be difficult if the beacons are very close and/or you are moving fast (riding or flying).
			You should use this feature wisely. For sighted players it could look slightly like a bot in some scenarios. Especially if the waypoints are very close to each other. I would suggest to avoid running and spamming it in crowed placed with lots of players. Stop and using it to turn is no problem. Beside that running and spamming could look strange to sighted players, it isn't working that good at places like cities, as waypoints there are usually quite close.

	Core
		- Changes on error notifications (under Core > Options > Error Feedback):
			- Several error notification types are now enabled as default.
			- The error notification output is now using the Blizzard TTS voice if an output is set to "spoken".
			- A new "other" error type was added to error notifications list. "Other" errors are all error types that are not explicit in the list.
		- The resource scan feature for herbs and mining nodes had some bug fixes and was been significantly enhanced:
			- There are still two scan types: 
				CTRL + SHIFT + R: do a 50 meters range scan around your position
				CTRL + SHIFT + F: do a 120 meters range scan around your position
			- The found resources (herbs, mining nodes) are now listed with a number, direction and distance for each. Example: 1 Peacebloom northwest 35 meter
				And the 4 quick waypoints are automatically set to the first 4 found resources per scan. resource one is quick waypoint one, two is two and so on.
				You then can just start a usual navigation to that quick waypoint (Shift F5 to F8 for Quick Waypoint 1 to 4) to get to the resource.
			- The directions, distances and quick waypoint positions are not 100% accurate. Depending on the distance they could be differ by up to 10 meters from the actual position of the herb or mining node.
				As a rule of thumb: the close a resource is, the less accurate the direction, distance and position.
				The accuracy of that information also highly depends on the scan speed. The faster the scan speed, the more unreliable the direction, distance and position.
				There is a setting to adjust the resource scanning speed: Core > Options > resource scanning > Accuracy. The default value is 3, which is a good tradoff between speed and accuracy. You can adjust that setting from 1 (very accurate, but very slow) to 5 (quite inaccurate, but very fast) if you would like to have more accurate or faster resource scans.

		- New feature: there are now options to adjust the sku addon key binds: Core > Sku key binds
			- Sku addon key binds are all key binds that are specific to the sku addon itself. Like Shift + F1 to open the menu. 
			- The Sku key binds are saved in the Sku profiles. Thus all characters with the same profile share the same Sku key binds.
		- Added Shift + G for "Interact with mouseover" to the default game key binds. You need that for the new scan looting/interacting feature below.
		- New feature: Scan and interact with mouseover for interacting with objects like mailboxes, objects in the game world, fishing, finding corpses and more.
			From now on you will use a scan feature and Shift + G for "Interact with mouseover" to find and use objects in the game world. You won't need the old turning and press numpad 7-9 feature anymore.
			
			How to use it:
				First of all: If you haven't done that yet, go to Core > Game Key binds > Bind Key > Targeting and set up a shortcut for "Interact with mouseover". (Default is Shift + G, but you can choose any other shortcut of your choice.)
				Scanning is automatically turning your camera around you (and thus the mouse pointer) very fast.
				While doing that it is constantly checking if the mouse pointer is getting over an object.
				if that is the case it instantly stops turning, and thus your mouse pointer will be on the object.
				With the mouse pointing on the object you then can press the new shortcut Shift + G (interact with mouse over) to right click on that object.
				Shift + G is working like the known shortcut G (interact with target), except it is interacting with the object under your mouse, instead of your current target.
				Your character will either directly use the object (if you are in use range), or move to the object and use it then.
				The scan stops on the first found object (see below for what objects the different scans are looking for).
				You then can either press SHIFT + G to interact with that object, or using SHIFT + L to continue the scan to find another object of that type.
				A running scan will be instantly stopped if you do start moving.

			The different scans:
				There are 8 different scans available. They have different ranges and accuracies and they are scanning for different objects. You will find details on them below this list.
					- Scan 1: SHIFT + U, 360 10 fast, herbs, mining nodes
					- Scan 2: SHIFT + I, 100 Front, fishing bobber
					- Scan 3: SHIFT + O, 360 10 fast, usable objects
					- Scan 4: SHIFT + P, 360 10 fast, lootable corpse, skinnable corpse
					- Scan 5: CONTROL + SHIFT + U, 360 30 fast, herb, mining nodes
					- Scan 6: CONTROL + SHIFT + O, 360 30 fast, usable objects
					- Scan 7: CONTROL + SHIFT + P, 360 30 fast, lootable corpse, skinnable corpse
					- Scan 8: CONTROL + SHIFT + I, 360 30 accurate, any
			
			Details on the scans:
				Each scan (1-8) consists of a specific scan type and a list of objects it is scanning for.
				You can assign or adjust any combination of scan type and object(s) to each of those 8 scans. To do that go to Core > Scan settings and to the specific scan (1-8).
				There are 5 different scan types to choose from. They differ in scan range, accuracy and speed.
					- Scan type 1: 100 front - 100 degrees in front of you, 5-45 meters range, takes up to 22 seconds. Used for fishing.
					- Scan type 2: 360 10, fast - 360 degrees around you, 0-10 meters, takes up to 10 seconds. Used for usual quick scanning of objects near you.
					- Scan type 3: 360 30, fast - 360 degrees around you, 3-30 meters, takes up to 15 seconds. Used for usual quick scanning of objects in up to 30 meters range.
					- Scan type 4: 360 10, accurate - 360 degrees degrees around you, 0-10 meters, takes up to 15 seconds. The more accurate version of scan type 2, if you can't find an object with scan 2.
					- Scan type 5: 360 30, accurate - 360 degrees degrees around you, 3-30 meters, takes up 28 seconds. The more accurate version of scan type 3, if you can't find an object with scan 3.
				And there are 12 different object types you can choose to scan for:
					- corpse lootable: any corpse that is lootable
					- corpse skinnable: any corpse that is skinnable
					- corpse not lootable: any corpse that is NOT lootable
					- any creature: any creature (mob, npc, player, etc.)
					- quest object: any object in the game world that is required for any of your current quests
					- herb: any herb for herbalism (only herbs are considered that are set to On under Core > Options > Resource scanning > Herbs)
					- vein: any mining node (only mining nodes are considered that are set to On under Core > Options > Resource scanning > Mining nodes)
					- bobber: the fishing bobber
					- usable object: any object that is usable/clickable (for example a mailbox)
					- any object: any object in the game world
					- target creature: the creature your are currently targeting (mob, npc, player, etc.)
					- any: any object in the game world
				Just go to Core > Scan settings and to the scan (1-8) you would like to configure/adjust. Then select a new scan type and/or add/remove object categories, to adjust that scan.

			Helpful information on scanning:
				Some "objects" don't count as objects. Examples are mage portals, meeting stones, dungeon portals. To find them, use a scan that is scanning for "any". (default: scan 8, Control + Shift + I)
				Scanning is turning the camera. That is working perfect on flat terrain. It can be problematic if there slopes, in buildings, etc. If a fast scan isn't detecting an object, just try an accurate scan.
				It can also be difficult if objects are covered by other objects (like mobs or players). Or if there are several objects at the same place (like 2 or 3 corpses almost at the same position).
				Small objects can be easily overlooked by fast scans. Set up scans to use an "accurate" scan type (4 or 5) to find those objects.
				Scanning can fail in some cases. Then the camera is turning slightly to far. If you do a scan, and there is an object, but nothing happens with Shift + G, just retry the scan.
				Scanning is finding a mob or object at the position where it is right now. If a mob is moving, then it naturally will move away from the mouse cursor if you don't press Shift + G as fast as possible on finding it.
				If you are continuing a scan, then only the first object of each type will be found, as the addon can't differentiate between more objects of the same type. This only applies to objects. Not to corpses, mobs, etc.
				If you would like to choose a new key binding for a specific scan, go to Core > Sku key binds > Bind key and filter for "scan".
				To change the sound on scanning go to Core > Options > Scan Background Sound

			Examples:
				- Fishing:
				- Looting:
				- Herbalism/mining:

		- Numpad 7 and numpad 8 are still available with their old functionality. But Numpad 9 isn't available anymore, as it is used for the auto turn towards the current beacon feature.
		- The old alternative "mouse click" key binds for Numpad 7-9 (CONTROL + SHIFT + I/O/P) are not longer working, as they are now assigned to scans.

		- New feature: Items in the character menu (C) and the bags manu (B) now have an additional submenu "Socketing" to open the socketing panel for that item. The socketing panel will be shown under Local, like all other panels.
			Workflow for socketing: 
				- Pick up the gem that should be placed in some socket from your bag with left click. Then the gem is attached to the cursor.
				- Open the character panel or bags, get to the relevant item and choose Socketing.
				- Go left to the Local menu level. Get to Local > Socketing.
				- Find the intended socket for the gem and do a left click to place the gem at the cursor in that socket.
				- Go down to Socket Gems and do a left click to finally socket the new gem.

		- Moved the All Bags menu entry in the bags menu below the single bags, to provide the option to jump to the single bags with the 1-5 keys. If you would like to get to All Bags with arrowing down, just press the A key, to jump to the first menu entry that starts with A (All Bags).
		
		- The key binding menu (Core > Game key binds) now provides a warning if you are trying to bind a key that already is bound to some other action. 
			You then can either press a new key to make a new choice, or again press the already bound key, to confirm the re-binding of that already bound key.
			In the later case the already bound key will be rebound to the new action and the previously bound action will be unbound.
		- Removed the second (alternative) key for a binding from the key bind lists, as it does not provide any value.
		- Key bindings F7-F12 are now as default (for new players or on reset) assigned to the action buttons 7-12 of the left additional action bar instead to the right additional action bar buttons 1-6.

		- The setting to add the item quality color like grey, green, blue is now enabled as default for new players/profiles. (Core > Options > Item settings > Show item quality)
		- Added an option to the external SkuFluegel addon for sighted players to remotely set you on unfollow. That will only work if you have this update installed.
		- Fixed a bug with the panic mode. It is working again. Happy panicking.
		- Fixed a bug with the minimap scan that was breaking the "mouse over" notification on first use of the scan.
		- Fixed a bug with Escape to cancel the key binding process.
		- Fixed a bug with the overview page that was releated to the guild members list.
		- Fixed a bug with missing pet action bar in Core > Action bars.

	Mapping: 
		- changed Add small waypoint from CTRL + SHIFT + P to ALT + P
		- changed Add large waypoint from CTRL + SHIFT + O to ALT + O
		- changed Show routes on minmap from CTRL + SHIFT + L to ALT + L
		- changed Show sku minmap from CTRL + SHIFT + K to ALT + K

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Core
		- Fixed a bug with the minimap scan that caused errors on starting combat.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
Changes in Sku r27.13

	Quest
		- Fixed an issue with Quests > starts in zone.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
Changes in Sku r27.12

	Core
		- New feature: Scanning for herbs and mineral veins
			If you have mining and/or herbalism, then you have the Find Herbs/Find Minerals skills/spells. On enabeling those, nearby spawns of herbs/mineral veins will appear on the minimap, if you're getting close to them. "Close" can be something between 60 and 140 meters.
			There are two new shortcuts to let the addon automatically scan and find those herbs and mineral veins on the minimap, and output the results.
			CTRL + SHIFT + R: do a 50 meters range scan around your position
			CTRL + SHIFT + F: do a 140 meters range scan around your position
			As long as the check is running there is a sound.
			The check can only done out of combat. It is automatically stopped if you get in combat during check.
			The 50 meters range takes <1 second. The 140 meters range takes 4 seconds.
			The addon will voice output all found resource types.
			Caution: Please don't hold Control durching the check. That will lead to empty results! (The scan is based on the game tooltip, and that is cleared while you hold Control.)
			There are new options to control the herb/mineral vein types that the scan is detecting: Core > Options > resource Scan
			There you can enable all different herb/mineral vein node types. As default all herbs and nodes are enabled.
		- Fixed a bug in the key bind menu. Missing bind options (like B for Toggle Backpack) should now be availabe.
		- The pet action bar is available for configuration (Core > Action bars).
			You can't remove the six default pet control actions (aggressive, passive, defensive and attack, wait follow). But you can move those actions to other action buttons.
			That means, there are only up to 4 action buttons left for special pet spells. (Pet bar has 10 slots.)
			If you are trying to remove the default control action, they will be automatically set to the bar again.
		- Fixed an issue with auction house scanning on high populated servers. Scan process should not get stuck anymore.
		- Limited the amount of auction house history price data that is recorded.
			Unlimited storage of history data is most probably the reason for unexpected resets of all addon settings.
			The addon now stores a maximum of 1.5M price data records. If there are more records, then the oldest records are deleted.
		- The addon isn't doing automatic auction house full scans anymore.
			Previously there was a full scan on opening the auction house, if a full scan was possible (only once every 15 minutes). That feature is removed, as is leads to issues on high populated servers (with a lot of auctions).
			Now full scans need to be triggered manually via the Update offline database option in the auction house menu.
			The offline database in the auction house menu and the price history data in item tooltips are based on those full scan data. If you don't manually trigger full scans, it won't be populated/updated. So, if you are using the offline database and/or the price history data, and if you would like to have up-to-date data, then you regulary need to use the Update offline database option.
		- Fixed a missing translation in action house bid workflow.
		- Fixed the bid/buy workflow for multiple actions to (hopefully) prevent the addon from bidding/buying incorrect auctions.

	Navigation
		- Added the terms "herbalism" and "mining" to waypoint names for herbs and mineral veins for easier filtering.
		- Changed the key binds to open the visual route data maps, to avoid unintenional use.

			CTRL + SHIFT + R changed to CTRL + SHIFT + L

		- Fixed missing routes in Ghostlands.
		- Added more routes all over the world.

Changes in release 27.5-beta1

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
Changes in release 27.3

	Core
		- Fixed the missing Left click option for choosing quest rewards.
		- Fixed a bug with current auction house price data in item tooltips. Current price data now should be shown, if there was at least one full scan completed in the current session (login or reload).
		- The average price in auction house tooltip data now is the Median value (instead of just the average, as before). The median is more robust against outliers (scam auctions with extreme high buy out prices). Thus the average value now is a realistic and usefull value.
		- The highest price in auction house tooltip data now ignores any auctions with prices > 10 times the median value. That should limit the highest price on auctions that are non-scam, and make that value usable.
		- Full scan starts and ends (every 15 minutes) on auction house open are now announced in voice and chat.
		- Fixed a but with vendor price in tooltips, where the vendor price line was shown multiple times.

	Navigation
		- For map editors only: fixed a bug with showing the additional Minimap.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

		- Fixed a but with vendor price in tooltips, where the vendor price line was shown multiple times.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
Changes in release 27.2

	Navigation
		- Samalam contributed a new feature to have visited waypoints flagged as "visited" in waypoint lists. Thanks a million! :)
			The feature is intended for farming stuff (killing mobs of a specific type, or collecting/gathering objects). It is enabled as default. 
			On reaching a waypoint (via routes or just waypoint navigation) it internally flags that waypoint as "visited" for 5 minutes.
			Visited waypoints have the word "visited" added in all waypoint lists.
			There are two options to control the feature: Navigation > Options > Track whether waypoints were visited and Visited automatically expires after.
			And there is a new menu entry to instantly clear all "visited" flags on request: Navigation > Waypoints > Clear visited.
		- The "By name" lists for Waypoints and routes were removed. There are only the default "By distance" lists left, as apparently no one was using "By name" at all. :)
		- There is a new option Navigation > Options > Show herb and mining node waypoints. Default: Off
		- Fixed an issue with hearthstone on active route navigation.

	Core
		- There are now audio outputs for Breath (on diving), Feign Death (hunter), and Exhaustion (on leaving the world boundaries).
			The spoken numbers are percent values. Example: "Breath 25" means, there is 25% breath left, before you start drowning.
		- Texts from books, letters, etc. in your bags are now readable using right click. The text will be shown via the Local menu.
		- Manually implemented the NPC dialog menu (that is the one that every NPC opens if he provides more than one option, like multiple quests, quests and vendor, etc.)
			The audio menu for Dialog is now much clearer and in the correct order, without any mysterious and complex "sub sections", "containers" etc.
		- Manually implemented all quest dialog menus (select, accept, progress, complete). Should be much more user friendly now.
		- Removed the categories "Quest Items" and "WoW Token (China Only)" from the auction house list.
		- Fixed an issue with bags that occured on opening the bags without using the audio menu at least once in the current session.
		- Fixed an issue with the mailbox and letters from auction house.

	Quest
		- Fixed an issue with the quest log in Orgrimmar.

	Chat
		- Fixed an issue with Chat > Options > TTS pause tags. Should now work as expected if set to Off.

	Options
		- There is a new line with the vendor price in item tooltips (below the action house price data).
		- Fixed issues with unwanted outputs and/or missing outputs via Blizzard TTS in menus.
		- Fixed an issue with missing "period period period" output for long texts in menu via the Blizzard TTS.

	Maps
		- Added more waypoints to the caves in Stonesplinter Valley.
		- Added waypoint comments to portals in Darnassus and Rut'theran.
		- Added routes to quest targets in moonglade lake.
		- Added a route for the alliance druid class quest (poison) in darkshore.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
Changes in release 27

	Options
		- All tooltips are now read by the Blizzard TTS, no matter if you have enabled the "Use Blizzard TTS for audio menu" option or not.
		- There is a new key for showing/reading tooltips: SHIFT + PAGE DOWN
			SHIFT + PAGE DOWN starts automatically reading the full tooltip from the current line without having to hold down the SHIFT key or arrowing down to the next line.
			You can use SHIFT + PAGE DOWN at any place with a tooltip to have it opened and read from the first line.
			Or you could use SHIFT (hold) + DOWN as before, arrowing down through tooltip lines and use SHIFT + PAGE DOWN at any line to start auto reading from that line.
			If the auto read mode is active, then you can use SHIFT (hold) + UP/DOWN at any point to stop the auto read and manually go through the lines as usual.
			Or you can just use SHIFT + PAGE DOWN again to stop the auto-read.
		- Changed the keybind for spelling out the current menu entry from SHIFT + RIGHT to CTRL + RIGHT.
		- Fixed an issue with reputation at Exalted/Hostile on the overview page.
		- The audio menu will not longer speak speak menu numbers for bag items, as the bag items have their own numbering. (Avoiding that irritating "1 1 <itemname>" spam.)
		- Fixed a bug with background sound (spooky whale song) on open Game Menu.
		- Added a new slash command "/sku version" to output the version number of the installed sku addon in the chat.

	Adventure Guide
		- This is a new main menu entry (SHIFT + F1, then DOWN to Adventure Guide). It is intended to provide additional/complementary information, that is not directly related to actual gameplay.
		  For now there is only a wiki with a lot of articles from wowpedia.com, providing more information and context on the game world. 
		  Other planned, but not yet implemented, features are: a browsable history/log of all of your activities in the game, and our FAQ ingame
		  There is a new key bind, to access the Link History (see below): SHIFT + F4
		- The wiki and links to wiki articles in tooltips:
			- Wiki articles:
				You will find a list of available wiki articles under Adventure Guide > Wiki > All articles. There are almost 16k articles for english and almost 4k german articles.
				Just go to the list, and arrow down to see the available articles. Or, probably better, as there are a _lot_ of articles, filter the list as usual.
				The actual article for each entry can be read via its tooltip. You can use all common tooltip features (SHIFT + UP/DOWN to get to the next line, CTRL + SHIFT for sections, etc.) - including the new SHIFT + PAGE DOWN feature to read the full tooltip without holding the shift key.
				The content of the articles was auto-imported from wowpedia.com. There was an automatic clean-up on the wiki content, to remove everything that can't be shown/read (like tables, images, videos, etc.). That automatic clean-up should have removed most parts that can't be read in our tooltips. However, there can be things left. Like HTML tags, external URLs and more. That is expected and shouldn't happen much. If you find articles that can't be read due to a lot of clutter, please report them.
				Most of the content provides details on the game you are playing. But it virtually could be anything. Even on external stuff like the WoW trading card game or trivia or whatever. It's just what the wiki had. There was no human review.
				It even could be that there are some wiki articles that are related to later Warcraft addons (like the upcoming Lich King).
				Wiki articles can have any size - from a single line to many hundreds of lines.
			- Links in wiki articles:
				As with any wiki the articles have lot of links, referencing other articles. If you are reading an article, the TTS will list all links in the current line at the end of that line.
				It will say "Links: x, y, z...".
				You then can use the new key binds SHIFT + RIGHT and SHIFT + LEFT to scroll through the links in the current line.
				If you would like to follow a link, then select the link with SHIFT RIGHT/LEFT and then, on the link, press the new key bind SHIFT + ENTER. That instantly loads the linked article to the tooltip.
				Then just read the new article in the tooltip as usual.
				If you would like to get back to the previous article, you can use the new key bind SHIFT + BACKSPACE. That loads the previous article to the tooltip.
				Tip: You don't have to wait until the current line is fully read to access the links. You can use SHIFT + LEFT/RIGHT at any point to select the links of that line. Even if the TTS still is reading.
			- Links in other parts of the game:
				As the main idea of the wiki was to provide you more context on the game while you're playing, from now on every term that has an article will be linked to the wiki article.
				All tooltip texts in the game are continously parsed on terms with wiki articles. If there is such a term, you will find the link listed in the tooltip.
				That applies to all tooltips. Items in your bags, items at vendors, text on the overview page, etc. Just to every text that is shown by Sku.
				It also applies to every audio output that is played by the sku addon. No matter if it is an area name on entering a new area, or a mob name on targeting that mob, or what ever.
				If the addon recognizes a wiki term in such outputs, it plays a sound and adds that term to a list of recent seen links.
				You will find that list under Adventure Guide > Wiki > Link history. It has all recently seen terms with wiki articles. The most recent term is at the top of the list. The oldest at the bottom.
				Just open the tooltip of an entry in the link history list to read the wiki article.
				Some additionl details on links:
					- The addon plays an audio notification on every linked term in outputs. But only once for each new term. The second time that a term appears somethere, it will be added to the link history list, but there won't be the link sound. The list of those "seen" links (no sound) is account wide (not just per character).
					- The sound on links can be changed or even silenced: Adventure Guide > Options > Link History > Sound on new link in history.
					- You can disable the announcement of links at the end of tooltip lines: Adventure Guide > Options > Links > List links in tooltips. The links are still be available, but the addon won't auto-read them anymore.
					- If you are using the new auto-read feature for tooltips (SHIFT + PAGE DOWN), then the addon never reads links at the end of the a line. But the links are still there and can be used.
					- There are more options. For example to use the link sound in tooltip lines, instead of having the addon read the word "Links".					

	Navigation
		- New waypoint and map data added for DE and EN (V23, 2022-05-01).
		- Fixed an issue with missing waypoints in "The Wailing Caverns".
		- Fixed an issue with broken routes in English data (due to incorrect translated waypoint names). Example: Jasperload Mine - should now be attached to the routes network.
		- Fixed an issue with broken routes that are connected to any Enchanting Supplier in English data. Example: route to shaman trainer in Exodar.

	Chat
		- All options to automatically read chat messages for different channels have been moved into a new submenu: Chat > Options > Auto read.
			Due to that all your current settings for those options are resetted to their defaults. (That is On for all of them.)
		- Added two new options to "Auto read": Raid chat and Raid Warning Chat. Both are On as default.
		- Fixed a bug with option "Automatically read SkuChat channel" if you manually joined the SkuChat channel.
		- New option "Chat > Options > TTS pause tags" (default: on). That option is to disable invisible (internal) "pause" and "pitch" tags (SAML) in TTS outputs.
			If you set that to Off, then the addon will play all TTS outputs without those tags. The effect will be minimal, as there are not that many strings containing a dedicated pause (prices in Auction house would be an example).
			The second use is if you're using the NVDA voice via Sapi. Set the option to Off, to have those tags (pitch, silence) removed, to avoid that NVDA is speaking them.

	Core
		- The addon now speaks the names of players and their pets via the Blizzard TTS. (Instead of the general "friendly player", etc. placeholders.)
			As it is not possible to integreate the Blizzard TTS into the TTS queue of the Sku addon, that output will be in parallel to all other outputs. There is not way to avoid that.
		- Fixed an issue with the missing removal of greeting audio on targeting NPCs in the English version.
			Actually everything those NPCs are saying to greet you should be silenced, as the audio menu will get active at the same time, and it is difficult to follow that if both outputs are played simultaniously. 
			That was not working and now should work. You won't hear such greetings anymore.
		- Added a new option Core > Options > Play NPC greetings to disable the removal of NPC greetings and have them played. Default: Off

	Core
		- There is a new option for bag items. Each bag item has an additional sub menu "Split" to split items stacks. (Only available if the item amount is > 1)
			Go to "Split", go to the submenu of Split and select the amount of items to split from that stack. 
			The splitted items will be added to the mouse cursor. Then go to an empty bag slot, and select Left Click there, to place the splitted items in that empty slot.
		- It is now possible to send less than 1 gold via mail. There are new numbers in the list for the amount of gold to send. Those are:
			0.01 to 0.09 (gold) - that is 1 silver to 9 silver
			0.1 to 0.9 (gold) - that is 10 silver to 90 silver
		- There is a new option "Core > Options > Item settings > Show item quality". The default value is Off. With that option set to On there will be the quality of an item added to every item name in lists, tooltips, etc.
			Example: "Robes of the Lich (Rare)". The item quality levels are: Poor (grey), Common (white), Uncommon (green), Rare (blue), Epic (pink). 
		- The options "Auto sell junk at vendors" and "Auto repair at vendors" under "Core > Options" have been moved to the new submenu "Core > Options > Item settings".
			Thus those two settings are resetted to their default values (On for both). If you had set them to Off, you need to do that again.

	Sku Minimap - only for route/waypoint editors (not relevant for players): 
		- Adjusted the waypoint size of the Sku MM on zooming in/out.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
Changes in release 26.2

	Navigation
		- Fixed an issue that lead to incorrect compass directions with "Show global direction in waypoint lists" enabled in some regions.

	DB
		- Added coordinates to npc Lillith Nefara in Tirisfal Glades.
		- Added a Start to the Quest Demon Scarred Cloak. (Not that useful, as that creature is wandering around.)

	Quest
		- Fixed a bug with quest start/target/end for objects and items that are on other continents (example: "Until Death Do Us Part", starts in Kalimdor, ends in Eastern Kingdoms). List was shown as Empty. Now there is an entry, letting you know the continent and zone name. You can't navigate there, tough, as one can't directly navigate from one continent to another. But you at least know what continent you need to  go to use a route to that waypoint.

	Core
		- Fixed CTRL + SHIFT + T to read tooltips of items you're currently rolling on.
		- Fixed missing en translations for "On" and "Off" for "Usable only" in action filters.
		- Fixed a bug with popup windows (like someone is inviting you to a group or guild). The addon was always selecting "Accept", not matter if you did a left click on "Accept" or "Decline". Now "Decline" is working as intended.
		- New option: "Auto sell junk at vendors" (default: On)
		- New option: "Auto repair at vendors" (default: On)


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
Changes in release 26.1

	SkuOptions
		- The "Use Blizzard TTS for audio menu" should now respect the settings from "Chat > Options > TTS voice" and "> TTS speed".

	SkuMob
		- Removed all outputs for players with "Announce player controled units with generic descriptions" set to Off.
		- Removed the in-combat-sound for player controlled units.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
Changes in release 26

	SkuOptions
		- New option: SkuOptions > Options > Use Blizzard TTS for audio menu. The default value is Off.
		  With that option the audio menu will use the Blizzard TTS engine for everything, instead of the usual custom Sku TTS engine. (Using settings in "Chat > Options > TTS voice and TTS speed".)
		  Please enable the new option, and test that carefully. Feedback on how useful that is would be appreciated. If it turns out to be better, I could set that option to On as default.
		- I've changed the names of the top level menu items and removed the "Sku" part from each name. The new menu item names are: Navigation, Mob, Chat, Quest, Core, Auras, Options, Local
		  Because of that names change, all menu shortcuts (Shift + F9-F12) are resetted to their defaults. If you had other menu items assigned to those shortcuts, you need to do that again.
		- Added the realm/server name to the line with the player name on the overview page.

	SkuQuest
		- Fixed a bug with available quests for Undead characters. The list shouldn't be empty anymore.

	SkuAuras
		- Fixed an issues with "item use"/"item count" and "output once". Should work as expected now.
		
	SkuNav
		- Fixed an issue with english localization of mailboxes. All mailboxes should now be available in waypoint and route lists.

	SkuChat
		- New option: while reading the chat you now can use Arrow Right to to tell/whisper the sender of the current chat line. You don't need to type the recipients name. Just press Arrow Right on any chat line and start typing your message + Enter to send. This feature needs to be tested carefully!
		- Fixed an issue with the click sound at the end of audio messages via the Blizzard TTS. If you've disabled that, it won't get re-enabled on reload/login anymore.

	SkuMob
		- New option SkuMob > Options > Announce player controled units with generic descriptions. The default value is On. With this option set to Off the addon won't speak generic descriptions for players, pets, etc. (Example: "friendly player" on targeting a friendlich player.)
		- New option SkuMob > Options > Repeat target markers on units. The default value is Off. With that option set to On each raid target marker will be repeated. (Example: "Skull, Skull, Level 60")

	SkuAuras
		- Added more number values to the "Item count" attribute (110, 120, 130, 140, 150, 200, 300, 400, 500).


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

		- Another bug fix for the list of available quests.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
Changes in release 25.15

	SkuChat
		- New option "SkuChat > Options > Audio Setting > Audio notification on the end of chat messages". Contributed by chpross. Thanks a lot! :)

	SkuQuest
		- Fixed another bug with the list of available quests. Quests with multiple pre-quests, where only one of those pre-quests needs to be completed, are now correctly shown.

	SkuNav
		- Added an option "Show global direction in waypoint lists" to "SkuNav > Options" (default: off). With that option enabled the global direction to the target will be added to all lists with waypoints or routes. (Example: "147 meter north Corrupted Scorpid...")
		- Fixed the "Auto announce global direction". The outputs are not queued anymore and will play in parallel to the queued outputs.

	SkuOptions
		- Added a new slash command /pquit to leave a group.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
Changes in release 25.14

	SkuQuest

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
Changes in release 25.13

	SkuQuest
		- Event/seasonal/holiday quest are now filtered from the "Available Quests" list if the event/season isn't currenlty active.
		- Fixed a bug with filtering the available quests by the players class and race.
		- Stumbled upon a lot of AQ war efforts quests (not available anymore) and removed them from the quest db.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
Changes in release 25.12

	SkuCore
		- Fixed a bug with the key ring in bags. (Don't care if you hadn't any issues with bags in r25.11)


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
Changes in release 25.11

	SkuCore
		- Fixed a bug with right click on items in bags.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
Changes in release 25.10

	SkuCore
		- Added a new feature for collecting objects (like the well known cactus apples) via mouse click / numpad: The addon now outputs the objects name if the mouse cursor is over such an collectible object.
		- The addon now is playing a background sound (whale song) if the game menu is open. That is, because the game menu easily can be opended unintentionally with Escape, and is blocking almost all other things. So, if you are suddenly hearing whales, press Escape to close that stupid game menu. :)
		- The stable masters union strike has come to an end. All their demands were accepted. As a result, starting from today, hunters will get the pet and the pets poop in a plastic bag on unstabling a pet.
		- Updated the bag menu. The bag menu now has much less confusing sub menus and buttons and is a lot clearer and easier to use.
		- The bag menu now has an additional sub menu "Bags" to manage your bag-item slots. 
			How to replace an existing bag:
			- Pick up the new bag-item from one of you bags with left click, to get that new bag-item to the cursor.
			- Go to "Bags" and to the target bag-item slot for that new bag-item.
			- Go right and do a left click, to place the new bag-item in the bag-item slot. The new bag-item and the existing bag-item will swap places.
		  	Replacing bags will only work if the existing bag is empty or the new bag-item has at least the same number of item-slots.
		- Items in bags now have an additional submenu "Destroy". CAUTION: The item will be destroyed without any additional confirmation!

	SkuNav:
		- On death and release the spirit the addon now starts a close route to your corpse (quick waypoint 4), instead of just selecting the quick waypoint 4.
		- Fixed a bug in the English map data that caused some routes to be broken. Rabbits are the root of all evil. Trust me on this one! Just kill'em on sight!
		- Map data updated for English and German (current version: V22Plus-21c-AlleKarten-2022-03-26)
			- Silverpine Forest: completed
			- Eversong Woods: completed
			- Barrens and Azuremyst Isle: fixes
		- The default sound (for new characters) on entering/leaving the 5 degree range of beacons was changed from "click" to "beep".
		- The default values (for new characters) for all range check distances and target type are now set to "vocalized".
		- The range check now should be instantly triggered on every target change (even on mobs with same names). There's still that 45 seconds delay after login, where no range checks are available.
		- Additionally to CTRL + SHIFT + F5-F8 to set the quick waypoints 1-4 to your own current position, you can now use CTRL + SHIFT + ALT + F5-F8 to set the quick waypoints to the position of your current target.
		  You can use that to navigate to party members. Just target the party member, use CTRL + SHIFT + F5 to set quick waypoint 1 to that party member, and the start a close route to quick waypoint 1.
		  That feature is only working if you're targeting party members, as the addon hasn't any access to the coordinates of non-party members.
		- There is a new option: SkuNav > Options > Auto announce global direction (default: off). With that enabled the addon automatically is announcing the global direction if you're turning.

	SkuChat
		- Added a sound for open/close of the chat input box.
		- Added the new command /sc to write to the SkuChat channel (additionally to the existing /skuchat).

	SkuOptions
		- Removed the option "SkuOptions > Options > Visual audio menu".


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
Changes in release 25.9

	- Updated the interface version to 2.5.4, to avoid the "outdated addons" notification on login.
	- Added a visual tag to bottom left corner of UI. The Sku Maus script is using that to recognise the game windows. No effects on addon usage or gameplay, though.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
Changes in release 25.8

	SkuChat
		- The addon now leaves the Looking For Group channel on first login.
		- Changed the default value for "Sound on chat message" to "On".

	SkuCore
		- Fixed a bug with missing option to choose a reward for some quests with multiple rewards.
		- Fixed a bug with missing "auto loot" and other default settings.
		- Changed "toggle auto run" in Sku default key bindings from numlock to "ALT + W".
		- Fixed a bug with constant "Pet happy" message spam. 
		- Fixed an issue with new messages if the chat is open.

	SkuMob
		- Your pet / companion now should be read as "your companion" (instead of "other companion").

	SkuNav:
		- Added faction areas for Horde and Alliance to Kalimdor and Eastern Kingdoms.
		- Added the newest map data for english and german.
		- Fixed an issue with missing audio for "nah" (German only).
		- Fixed an issue with zone "The Dead Scar" / "Die Todesschneise"

	SkuOptions:
		- Changed the default values for "Speak menu numbers" and "Announce submenus" in "SkuOptions > Options" to "On".
		

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
Changes in release 25.7

	SkuAuras
		Bug fixes
			- Next try to fix that issue with the "contains" operator. Tested with "target change with debuff" and "melee damage". Both working. But I am sure there's something else broken now. :D

	SkuOptions
		Bug fixes
			- Fixed a bug with updating the money on the overview page.

	SkuMob
		New
			- The addon now uses generic terms for player controlled units with unkown names, instead of playing the "beep" for missing words:
				- "you" (targeting yourself)
				- "your companion" (targeting your companion / pet)
				- "friendly player" (targeting a player from your faction)
				- "unfriendly player" (targeting a player from other faction)
				- "other companion" (targeting a companion / pet of another player)


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
Changes in release 25.6
	
	SkuAuras
		Bug fixes
			- (Again) fixed an issue with "contains" operator.

	SkuChat:
		Bug fixes
			- Fixed an issue with "Automatically read SkuChat channel". Should be read now.

	SkuNav
		Bug fixes
			- Added Silvermoon to the list of words for waypoint names.
			- Fixed the zone ID for Shadowfang Keep area.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
Changes in release 25.5
	
	SkuNav
		Bug fixes
			- Fixed an issue with missing waypoints in Nagrand.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
Changes in release 25.4
	
	SkuChat:
		New features
			- The default value for "SkuChat > Options > Automatically read whisper chat" now is On.
			- There is a new option: "Automatically read SkuChat channel". The default value is On.

	SkuNav
		Bug fixes
			- EN only: Waypoints for herbs like "Silverleaf" and minining nodes like "Copper Veign" are now filtered from all lists, as intended.
			- Waypoints with "[DND]" in their names are now filtered from any lists and should not be visible anymore.
			- Additional fix for metaroute calculation via SkuQuest.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
Changes in release 25.3
	
	SkuNav
		Bug fixes
			- Fixed an issue with metaroute calculation that caused lag with "SkuNav > Route > Follow route" in Hellfire Peninsula. The range for available entry waypoint was lowered from 1000 to 300 meters/yards. That means, if there isn't any waypoint in a range of 300 meters linked to the route network, then "SkuNav > Route > Follow route" will show an empty list (no entry point). Move closer to a linked waypoint in such cases.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
Changes in release 25.2
	
	SkuNav
		Bug fixes
			- Fixed an issue with missing route data for first time users. Route data should be available on next login.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
Changes in release 25.1
	
	The localization is completed. The addon is ready to test with language set to "English" (in the Battle.Net client). Please report all missing words and issues!
	How to move from German to English:
	- You need to delete the "Account" folder in "World of Warcraft\_classic_\WTF\Account". You will lose all existing profiles, settings, etc. for all addons.
	- You need to download "SkuAudioData_en 3" via https://duugu.github.io/Sku/
	- You either need to deactivate "SkuAudioData 30" in the addon list ingame, or to delete the folder "SkuAudioData" from you addons folder.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
Änderungen in Version 25

	Alle
		- Die Vorbereitung der Lokalisierung wurde mit weiteren internen Codeänderungen abgeschlossen.
		  Vereinzelte Fehler sind möglich. Bitte alles gründlich durchtesten und auftretende Fehler melden. Danke!

	SkuCore
		Neuerungen
			- Das Addon sollte jetzt die bekannten Fehlermeldungen wie "Ein Addon wurde geblockt ..." und "Du versuchst ein Script auszuführen ..." verhindern bzw. entsprechende Warnungen vollautomatisch mit "Ok" bestätigen.
		
		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- Das Addon sollte jetzt endgültig beim ersten Öffnen des Klassentrainer-Fensters alle nicht verfügbaren Skills ausblenden.

	SkuAuras
		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- Es wurde ein Fehler bei Auren mit dem Operator "gleich" bzw. "ungleich" behoben.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	SkuAuras
		Fehlerkorrekturen

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
Änderungen in Version 24.3

	SkuDB
		Neuerungen
			- Zur Integration von Daten in anderen Sprachen musste die Datenbankstruktur erheblich verändert werden.
			  Mir sind zwar bei Tests keinerlei Fehler aufgefallen, aber das muss nichts bedeuten. :) Bitte bei komischen Dingen direkt melden! Danke.

	SkuAuras
		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- Es wurde ein Fehler beim Operator "enthält" behoben. Zum Beispiel hat "wenn debuff liste enthält xyz" dadurch nicht funktioniert.

	SkuQuest
		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- Ein Fehler in ca. 800 Questtexten wurde behoben, der bei einzelnen Wörtern im Questtext zu Piepsern geführt hat.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
Änderungen in Version 24.2

	SkuChat
		Neuerungen
			- Es gibt einen neuen Chat Channel, dem das Sku-Addon automatisch beitritt. Der Channel Name lautet "SkuChat"
			  Das bedeutet, dass nun jeder Benutzer des Sku-Addons automatisch in diesem Chat Channel ist. So können neue Benutzer einfach mit erfahrenen Benutzern Kontakt aufnehmen.
			  Du kannst den Channel über "SkuChat > Optionen > Sku Chat Channel beitreten" verlassen bzw. wieder beitreten. Standardmäßig bist du drin.
			  Du kannst wie bei /say oder /tell etc. mit /skuchat direkt in den Channel schreiben, oder wie bei allen anderen Channels die Channelnummer verwenden (per /chatinfo rausfinden).

	SkuNav
		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- Für die Sku-Minimap sollte jetzt nach dem Einloggen auf der Höllenfeuerhalbinsel korrekt "Current Zone" statt "Scherbenwelt" ausgewählt sein.
			- In der Zone "Höllenfeuerzitadelle" wird jetzt die Karte korrekt angezeigt.

	SkuCore
		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- Ohne Bagnon gibt es jetzt immerhin keinen Fehler mehr beim Taschen-Öffnen. Die Taschen ohne Bagnon sind allerdings im Moment total kaputt. Ich mag sie auch nicht reparieren, da ja eh alle Bagnon nutzen. :)


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
Änderungen in Version 24.1

	SkuNav
		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- Ein Fehler wurde behoben, durch den die Routen nach dem Update auf Sku 24 erst nach einem einmaligen Reload funktioniert haben.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
Änderungen in Version 24

	SkuAuras
		Neuerungen
			- Es gibt ein neues vordefiniertes Aura-Set: "Schutz Krieger". Dieses enthält bisher jedoch erst eine einzige Aura zum Tanken, die dich warnt, wenn dein Ziel ein anderes Gruppenmitglied im Ziel hat oder ins Ziel nimmt.
			- Die meisten Bedingungen stellen Einzelwerte dar. Beispiel: "Im Kampf" kann nur "Wahr" oder "Falsch" sein. 
			  Einige Bedigungen stellen jedoch Liste von mehreren Werten dar. Beispiel "zauber auf cd". Diese Bedingung enthält keinen Einzelwert, sondern ist eine Liste alle Zauber die gerade auf Cooldown sind.
			  Solche Bedingungen können zusätzlich mit "enthält" und "enthält nicht" abgefragt werden. Beispiel: "zauber auf CD enthält Wirbelwind".
			  Solltest du "gleich" oder "ungleich" verwenden, wird ab jetzt stillschweigend intern "gleich" durch "enthält" und "ungleich" durch "enthält nicht" ersetzt.
			  Zur Verdeutlichung ist ab sofort an die entsprechenden Bedingungen ein (L für "Liste") angehängt. Die Bedingung "zauber auf CD" heißt daher jetzt also z. B. "zauber auf CD (L)".
			- In der Aura-Verwaltung (Aktivierte/Deaktiviere) kann man jetzt Tooltips für die Auren in den Listen anzeigen.
			- Es gibt einen neuen Wert zur Abfrage von Einheiten: "gruppenmitglieder ohne dich". Dieser zutriff für alle Gruppenmitglieder außer dir zu. (Im Gegensatz zu "Gruppenmitglieder", der für alle Gruppenmitglieder inkl. dir zutriff.)

		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- Die Bedingung "zauber nicht auf cd" wurde wieder entfernt. Sie ist unnötigt. Verwendet stattdessen "Zauber auf CD enthält NICHT xyz" (siehe oben zu Listen).
			- Es wurden Fehler bei den Bedingungen "zauber auf cd", "Buff Liste Ziel" und "debuff Liste Ziel" behoben, die dafür gesorgt haben, dass diese Bedingungen nicht funktionierten.
			- Zauber- und Gegenstandsnamen sollten jetzt immer angesagt werden, wenn als Ausgabe Zauber- bzw. Gegenstandsname ausgewählt ist.
			- Die Abfrage/Ansage der Gegenstandsanzahl funktioniert jetzt auch bei Gegenständen die auf Auktionsleisten liegen (bisher hat das nur über die Tasche funktioniert).
			- Eine vergessene Debug-Ausgabe beim Verwalten von Auren wurde entfernt.

	SkuNav
		Neuerungen
			- Die Routendaten werden jetzt intern nicht mehr pro Sku-Profil gespeichert, sondern nur einmal pro Account für alle Chars gemeinsam. 
			  Auf die Benutzung der Routen hat das keine sichtbaren Auswirkungen.
			  Es sorgt jedoch dafür, dass die gespeicherten Variablen (WTF-Ordner) langfristig kleiner werden, und somit hoffentlich auch die Ladezeiten reduziert werden. 
			  Wenn ihr bereits unterschiedliche Profile verwendet, bleiben die alten Daten in jedem einzelnen Profil so lange gespeichert, bis ihr euch einmal mit einem Char einloggt, der das Profil verwendet.
			  Die gespeicherten Daten werden also nicht direkt nach dem Update auf diese Sku-Version von Zauberhand kleiner werden und die Ladezeiten nicht sinken.
			  Die Alternative zum Anmelden mit jedem verwendeten Profil ist die Dateien "Sku.lua" und "Sku.lua.bak" im WTF-Ordner zu löschen. Aber Achtung: Das setzt alles zurück. Danach ist das Sku-Addon für alle Chars wie frisch installiert.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
Änderungen in Version 23.25

	SkuAuras
		Neuerungen
			- Es gibt eine neue Bedingung namens "zauber nicht auf cd".
			- Es wurde ein Problem behoben, bei dem Bedingungen mit den Attributen "Eigene Ressource" oder "Eigene Gesundheit" im Zusammenhang mit einem Cooldown-Ende eines Zaubers zweimal augelöst wurden.

	SkuQuest
		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- Die Quest "Von den Kristallen lernen" sollte jetzt in der Datenbank funktionierende Ziele haben.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
Änderungen in Version 23.24

	SkuChat
		Neuerungen
			- Das automatische Vorlesen des Gruppenchats ist jetzt um eine Option zum automatischen Vorlesen von Chatnachrichten von Kreaturen (NPCs, Mobs, Bosse etc.) erweitert (standardmäßig deaktiviert).
			  Die Option liest alles vor was von Kreaturen kommt - "Sagen", "Schreien", "Flüstern", "Emote".

	SkuAuras
		Neuerungen
			- Es gibt diverse neue Werte für Einheiten: gruppenmitglied 0-4, fokus, ziel deines ziels, ziel deines fokus, ziel von gruppenmitglied 0-4
			  Damit kannst du zum Beispiel testen, ob eine Quell- oder Zieleinheit eines Ereignisses dem Ziel deines Ziels entspricht.
			- Es gibt eine neue Bedingung: "ziel deines ziels". Damit kannst du testen, ob das Ziel deines Ziels einer bestimmten Einheit entspricht (z. B. du selbst, beim Tanken).
			- Es gibt drei neue Sounds von Nils für Auren: "aura sound hinweis 25" bis "aura sound hinweis 27". Dafür ist SkuAudioData 30 erforderlich.

		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- Das Aktivieren und Deaktivieren von Auren funktioniert jetzt auch dann korrekt, wenn die Liste der Auren gefiltert ist.

	SkuOptions
		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- Die Übersichtsseite verursacht jetzt keinen Fehler mehr, wenn sich Gildenmitgliedern in unbekannten Zonen aufhalten.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
Änderungen in Version 23.23

	SkuChat
		Neuerungen
			- Das automatische Vorlesen des Gruppenchats ist jetzt bei neuen Profilen/Chars standardmäßig aktiviert.

	SkuOptions
		Neuerungen
			- In der linken oberen Bildschirmecke wird jetzt ein winziges blaues Quadrat angezeigt. Das ist kein Fehler. Es dient dazu, dass das Sku-Maus Skript die Spielwelt erkennen kann.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
Änderungen in Version 23.22

	SkuCore
		Neuerungen
			- Beim Folgen bzw. Folgen beenden wird jetzt grundsätzlich nicht mehr "Folgen"/"Folgen beendet" gesagt, sondern es gibt die bekannten zwei Pling-Sounds (hoch, tief). Das gilt auch für das automatische ab- und anhängen beim Casten.

		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- In den Taschen werden die Zahlen für die Anzahl der Gegenstände in einem Taschenplatz jetzt korrekt aktualisiert.
			- Im Auktionshausmenü funktionieren jetzt die Tooltips für die Offline-Datenbank

	SkuNav
		Neuerungen
			- Die Kartendaten aus V22Plus-14-AlleKarten-2022-02-12 sind jetzt bereits im Addon enthalten.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
Änderungen in Version 23.21

	SkuCore
		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- Ein Problem mit Gegenstandsbewertungen in Tooltips, das die Tooltips an vielen Stellen kaputt gemacht hat, wurde behoben.
			- Die Gegenstandsbewertungen stehen für viele Gegenstände nicht mehr zur Verfügung.
				Gegenstände, die einen Basisgegenstand haben, und einen zufälligen Wert bekommen, können nicht bewertet werden.
				Beispiel dazu: "Azuritring der Ausdauer". Bei diesem Gegenstand handelt es sich um den Basisgegenstand "Azuritring", den es in vielen verschiedenen Varianten geben kann.
				Azuritring der Ausdauer (mit Ausdauer), Azuritring der Eule (mit Int und Wille), Azuritring des Affen (mit Beweglichkeit) etc. pp.
				Heißt ein Gegenstand also "xyz der/des irgendwas", dann ist vermutlich keine Bewertung möglich.
				Daran wird sich auch vorerst nichts mehr ändern. Ich stecke keine Weitere Arbeit mehr in dieses Feature. :)


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
Änderungen in Version 23.20

	SkuCore
			Fehlerkorrekturen
			- Bei der Entferung wurde bisher nicht die aktuelle Entferung sondern immer der nächste Entferungsschritt angesagt. 
			  Beispiel: Bei 35 Meter Entferung wurde 30 gesagt. Bei 30 Meter Entferung wurde 25 gesagt.
			  Das wurde behoben. Jetzt passt die Entferungsangabe.

	SkuChat
		Neuerungen
			- Es gibt jetzt unter "SkuChat > Optionen" zwei weitere Optionen, um auch den Gildenchat und Flüsterchat automatisch vorlesen lassen zu können.

		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- Automatisch vorgelesene Chatnachrichten brechen jetzt nicht mehr die Ausgabe der vorherigen Nachricht ab.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
Änderungen in Version 23.19

	SkuCore
		Neuerungen
			- Die Gegenstandsbewertungen sind zurück. Diesmal ohne Pawn und selbstgebaut. Bitte ausführlich prüfen, ob die angezeigten Verbesserungen/Verschlechterungen Sinn ergeben.
			  Folgende Einschränkungen gelten für die Bewertungen:
				- Werte, die sich auf andere Gegenstände auswirken, werden nicht berücksichtig (Beispiel: Waffe erhöht den Blockwert eines Schildes)
				- Sockel und Sockelboni werden nicht berücksichtigt
				- Verzauberungen werden nicht berücksichtigt
				- Boni von Item-Set werden nicht berücksichtigt
				- Aktiverbare Effekte werden nicht berücksichtigt
				- Ringe und Schmuckstücke werden immer mit Ring 1 bzw Schmuckstück 1 verglichen


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
Änderungen in Version 23.18

	SkuNav
		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- Es wurde ein Fehler beim Routenfolgen behoben, der auftrat, wenn man bereits einer Route gefolgt hat, und dann im Menü mögliche andere Routen durchgesehen hat, ohne eine neue Route auszuwählen.

	SkuOptions
		Neuerungen
			- Die neuen vier Standard-Profile (Allgemein, Heiler etc.) werden jetzt auch dann automatisch erstellt, wenn man sich nicht zum allerersten Mal in WoW einloggt.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
Änderungen in Version 23.17

	SkuChat
		Neuerungen
			- Es gibt jetzt unter "SkuChat > Optionen" eine Option namens "Gruppenchat automatisch lesen".
			  Sie ist standardmäßig aus. Wenn du die Option aktivierst, wird jede neue Chatnachricht im Gruppenchat (/p) direkt vorgelesen - ohne, dass du das Chatfenster offen hast.
			  Du kannst diese Ausgabe wie alle Audioausgaben mit der rechten Shift-Taste abbrechen.

	SkuNav
		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- Möglicherweise :) wurde ein Fehler behoben, der sporadisch beim Folgen von Routen auftaucht. Bitte weiter beobachten. Melden, wenn eine Routenverfolgung unerwartet beendet wird.
			- Auch unter "wegpunkt, auswählen, atuelle karte entfernung ... nahe routen" wird jetzt zuerst "Nach Entferung" und dann "Nach Name angezeigt".

	SkuCore
		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- Eine vergessene Debug-Ausgabe bei der Übersichtsseite wurde entfernt.
			- Die Grundeinrichtung beim ersten Einloggen mit WoW überhaupt bzw. mit einem neuen Char sollte jetzt funktionieren.
			  Beim ersten Einloggen in WoW überhaupt wird die Sku-Tastenbelegung eingestellt.
			  Bei ersten Einloggen mit einem Char werden nur die Char-bezogenen Einstellungen eingestellt. Die bestehende globale Tastenbelegung bleibt erhalten.
			- Das Zurücksetzen auf die Standardtastenbelegung legt jetzt nicht mehr ungewollte die Tastenkombinationen STRG + F1-F12 fest.

	SkuOptions
		Neuerungen
			- Neu erstellten Chars wird jetzt automatisch ein neues Sku-Profil mit dem Namen "Standard profil Allgemein" zugewiesen, statt jedem neuen Char ein eigenes Profil mit seinem Namen zuzuweisen.
			- Es gibt zudem unter "SkuOptions > Optionen > Profil" drei weitere neue Sku-Standardprofile zur Auswahl: "Standard profil Heiler", "Standard profil Caster", "Standard profil Nahkämpfer", die du für alle entsprechenden Chars verwenden kannst.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
Änderungen in Version 23.16

	SkuCore
		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- Die automatische Einrichtung der Sku-Standardtastenbelegung beim allerersten Öffnen des Spiels wurde vorerst deaktiviert, da die Funktion anscheinend Probleme macht und eine schon bestehende Tastenbelegung löscht. Man kann sie aber natürlich noch immer über "SkuCore > Tastenbelegung" ausführen.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
Änderungen in Version 23.15

	SkuCore
		Neuerungen
			- Es gibt jetzt testweise ein kurzes Tutorial für neue Spieler für Feedback.
			  Das Tutorial startet am Spawnpunkt im Nordhain. Mach dir einen neuen Menschen, betretet wie Welt, und startet das Tutorial mit dem folgenden Befehl:
			  /run SkuCore:TutorialStart()
			  Du benötigst für das Tutorial die neueste Audiodata-Version (29)

		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- Die Übersichtsseite sollte deine Gruppe jetzt auch in Raidgruppen korrekt anzeigen.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
Änderungen in Version 23.14

	SkuAuras
		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- Die Eingabe einer Zahl bei Bedingungen mit Zahlen (z. B. "Anzahl Gegenstände") funktioniert jetzt wieder korrekt.

	SkuNav und SkuQuest
		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- "Nach Name" und "Nach Entferung" haben in allen relevanten Menüs die Plätze getauscht. Erster Punkt ist jetzt immer "Nach Entfernung".

	SkuCore
		Neuerungen
			- Unter "SkuCore > Optionen" gibt es eine neue Option namens "Folgen beim Zaubern temporär beenden" für Heiler bzw. Caster.
			  Wenn du die Option aktivierst, und gerade einem anderen Spieler folgst, wird das Folgen automatisch beendet, wenn du einen Zauber mit Castzeit beginnst. Wenn der Zauber abgeschlossen ist, wird das Folgen dann automatisch wieder aufgenommen.
			  Die Option ist standardmäßig aus. Sie funktioniert nur mit Spielern in deiner Gruppe bzw. deinem Raid.
			- Die Standardbelegung des Schnellzugriffs 3 (SHIFT + F11) ist jetzt "SkuCore > Aktionsleisten"
			- Die Standardbelegung des Schnellzugriffs 4 (SHIFT + F11) ist jetzt "SkuNav > Alles abwählen"
			- Da sich die Funktion "Bei Interagieren zum Ziel laufen" als hilfreich erwiesen hat, ist sie jetzt bei neuen Profilen standardmäßig eingeschaltet.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
Änderungen in Version 23.13

	Die Datei mit den verfügbaren Maus- und Tastenkombinationen des Sku-Addons (shortcuts.txt) im Sku-Ordner wurde aktualisiert

	SkuCore
		Neuerungen
			- Das Sku-Addon richtet nun beim allerersten Einloggen in WoW automatisch die folgenden kontoweiten Einstellungen ein:

			  - Aktionsleisten anzeigen: immer
			  - Kamera folgen: immer
			  - Sku-Standardtastenzuweisungen für die kontoweite Tastenbelegung
			- Das Sku-Addon richtet beim ersten Einloggen mit einem neuen Char automatisch die folgenden Char-Einstellungen ein:
			  - Filterliste bei Lehrern: nur verfügbare
			  - Zusätzliche Aktionsleisten anzeigen: Zusatzaktionsleiste oben links/rechts, Zusatzaktionsleiste 1 und 2 rechts
			  - Tastenbelegung: kontoweit


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
Änderungen in Version 23.12

	SkuAuras
		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- Aura-Ausgaben sollten jetzt (vermutlich) nicht mehr von anderen Ausgaben überschrieben oder verschluckt werden.
			- Beim Bearbeiten der Ausgaben von bestehenden Auren werden die neu gewählten Ausgaben jetzt in der richtigen Reihenfolge in die bearbeitete Aura übertragen. (Bisher war die Reihenfolge der Ausgaben nach dem Bearbeiten ungedreht.)
			- Bei Attributen mit Zahlenwerten (z. B. "Eigene Ressource" oder "Eigene Gesundheit") sind jetzt alle Zahlen von 0 bis 100 verfügbar, statt nur Zehnerschritte.
			- Die Listen der aktivierten und deaktivierten Auren können jetzt wie vorgesehen ganz normal über den Menüfilter gefiltert werden.
			

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
Änderungen in Version 23.11

	SkuAuras
		Neuerungen
			- Es gibt ein neues Attribut namens "Zauber auf CD". Mit diesem kannst du in einer Bedingung prüfen, ob ein Zauber gerade auf Cooldown ist.
			- Zusätzlich zu "Audio Ausgabe" und "Chat Ausgabe" gibt es zwei neue Ausgabetypen: "audio ausgabe einmal" und "chat ausgabe einmal"
			  Bei diesen Ausgabetypen erfolgt die Ausgabe beim Zutreffen der Aura nur einmal. 
			  Die nächste Ausgabe erfolgt frühestens dann, wenn die Aura mindestens einmal _nicht_ zugetroffen hat.
			  Beispiel-Aura: "Wenn eigene Gesundheit kleiner 90 Prozent dann audio ausgabe einmal Ping".
			  Bei dieser Aura wird nur ein einziges mal Ping ausgegeben, wenn deine Gesundheit unter 90 Prozent fällt. 
			  Erst, wenn sie einmal wieder über 90 Prozent war, und dann erneut unter 90 Prozent fällt, kommt die Ausgabe erneut.

	SkuCore
		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- Die neue Funktion "Bei Interagieren zum Ziel laufen" reagiert jetzt nur noch wenn du die Interagieren-Taste (G) drückst.
			  Sie reagiert nicht mehr bei Mausklicks in der Spielwelt (z. B. beim Kürschnern, bei Briefkasten etc.).


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
Änderungen in Version 23.10

	SkuCore
		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- Ein Problem mit den Tooltips wurde behoben. Sie funktionieren jetzt wieder.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
Änderungen in Version 23.9

	SkuCore
		Neuerungen
			- Es gibt eine neue Einstellung namens "Bei Interagieren zum Ziel laufen". Du findest sie unter "SkuCore > Optionen". Sie ist standardmäßig aus.
			  Wenn du die Einstellung einschaltest, läuft dein Char bei jeder Benutzung deiner "Mit dem Ziel interagieren Taste" (G) automatisch in gerader Linie zur Position deines jeweiligen Ziels.
			  Das funktioniert für alles was du ins Ziel nehmen kannst. Gegner, NPCs, Leichen etc.
			  Am Zielpunkt bleibt dein Char automatisch stehen. Wenn du dich während des automatischen laufens bewegst, wird das automatische Laufen abgebrochen.
			  Ein paar Tips dazu:
			  - Dein Char läuft Luftline zur Zielposition. Hindernisse werden nicht erkannt oder umlaufen.
			  - Dein Char läuft nicht deinem Ziel hinterher. Er läuft nur automatisch zu der Position, an der sich das Ziel beim Drücken der Interagieren-Taste befunden hat.
			  - Wenn du die Interagieren-Taste mit der Funktion drückst, und die Bewegung sofort wieder abbrichst, hast du dich zum Ziel gedreht.
			  - Das Ganze funktioniert überall in der Spielwelt. Auch in Instanzen.
			  - Es geht auch mit Spielern im Ziel. So wie mit Folgen. Nur, dass du beim automatischen Laufen mit Interagieren nicht dauerhaft folgst, sondern nur einmal zur entsprechenden Position läufst.

		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- Das Modul für die Gegenstandsbewertungen musste deaktiviert werden. 
			  Die Bewertungen basieren auf Code des Pawn-Addons. Anscheinend ist bei Pawn beim letzten WoW-Patch was kaputtgegangen. 
			  Der Code im Sku-Addon und Pawn liefert entweder gar keine Ergebnisse mehr, oder nur noch Schrottwerte. Außerdem verursacht er seitdem starke Lags.
			  Möglicherweise kommt die Funktion wieder, falls es irgendwann ein Update für Pawn gibt, und ich den Code im Sku-Addon auf der Basis aktualisieren kann.
			- Im Auktionshausmenü wurden vergessen Debug-Ausgaben entfernt.

	SkuCore
		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- Beim Wechsel des Kontinents (Ruhestein, Portal etc.) mit laufender Routenverfolgung gibt es jetzt keinen Fehler mehr. Stattdessen wir die laufende Route einfach beendet.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
Änderungen in Version 23.8

	SkuOptions
		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- Eine vergessene Debug-Ausgabe wurde entfernt getan gemacht hätten, würde können.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
Änderungen in Version 23.7

	SkuOptions
		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- Die Tooltips für das Talentfenster etc. funktionieren jetzt wieder.

	SkuCore
		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- Ein Fehler beim automatischen Verkaufen wurde behoben.
			- Vor den Bewertungen für Gegenstände werden jetzt auch für Magier die Namen der Spezialisierungen angezeigt.
			- Die Prozentwerte für Gesundheit und Mana werden jetzt auch unter 100% korrekt angezeigt.
			- Im Verkaufen-Menü des Auktionshauses werden jetzt Tooltips für die Gegenstände angezeigt.
			- Möglicherweise werden jetzt beim Verkaufen mehrere Auktionen korrekt erstellt. Bitte testen.

Änderungen in Version 23.6

	SkuCore
		Neuerungen
			- Automatisch verkaufen und reparieren haben jetzt Audiomeldungen.
			- Im Lokal-Menü steht jetzt nicht mehr "Button:" vor Buttons.
			- Auf der Übersichtsseite werden jetzt unter "Allgemein" deine Gesundheit und Mana, Wut, Energie angezeigt (Prozent und absolut).
			- Für benutzbare Gegestände wird jetzt ganz unten im Tooltip eine Wertung für deine möglichen Spezialisierungen angezeigt. 
			  Die Wertung zeigt die Verbesserung bzw. Verschlechterung durch den Gegenstand gegenüber des aktuell angelegten Gegenstands an.
			  Bitte nimm diese Wertung nicht als einzige Quelle der Wahrheit. Sie basiert auf bestimmten annahmen, die nicht unbedingt auf dich oder deine Spielweise zutreffen müssen. Sie ist also eher als grobe Richtlinie zur Entscheidungshilfe zu verstehen.
			  Die Wertung berücksichtigt zurzeit weder Verzauberungen noch Edelsteinsockel von Gegenständen.
			- Du kannst jetzt Gegenstände manuell für das automatische Verkaufen von Schrott festlegen.
			  Standardmäßig werden nur graue Gegenstände automatisch verkauft. Im Taschenmenü findest du jetzt unter jedem Gegenstand die Option "Für Auto Verkaufen markieren".
			  So markierte Gegenstände werden ab dann automatisch ohne Rückfrage mit dem Schrott verkauft - egal, ob sie grau, weiß, grün blau oder legendär sind. Also vorsicht!
			  Du kannst die Markierung genauso über den Gegenstand im Taschenmenü wieder aufheben.
			  Die Liste der zu verkaufenden Gegenstände wird pro Char gespeichert.

Änderungen in Version 23.5

	SkuNav
		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- Ein Problem mit der Karte vom Schwarzfels wurde behoben.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
Änderungen in Version 23.4

	SkuCore
		Neuerungen
			- Grauer Schrott wird jetzt automatisch verkauft, sobald ein Händlerfenster offen ist.
			- Es wird jetzt automatisch repariert, sobald ein Händlerfenster mit Reparaturmöglichkeit offen ist, und du genug Gold hast.
			- Leatrix ist somit nicht mehr notwendig.

		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- Im AH-Menü sind jetzt unter "Neue Auktion" Tooltips für die verkaufbaren Gegenstände vorhanden.

	SkuAuras
		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- Es wurde ein Fehler behoben, bei dem nach einem Zonenwechsel (z. B. Portal) das Erstellen von Auren mit Textwerten (z. B. Zaubername) fehlschlug.
			- Statt zweimal das Attribut "Ziel angreifbar" gibt es nun wie vorgesehen "Quell Einheit angreifbar" und "Ziel Einheit angreifbar".
			- Wenn bei der Auswahl der Ausgabewerte ein Filter aktiv ist, wird jetzt korrekt der gefilterte ausgewählte Wert in die Aura übernommen statt der erste Wert der ungefilterten Liste.
			- Die Attribut-, Operator- und Wert-Listen sind jetzt korrekt alphabetisch sortiert.

		Neuerungen
			- Aura-Sets:
				- Das Schattenpriester-Set wurde in zwei geteilt: "Priester alle" (z. B. Buffs und CDs von allgemeinen Zaubern) und "Priester Schatten" (z. B. DoTs, Schattengestalt etc.). Übernehme als Schattenpriester einfach beide Sets nacheinander.
				- Das Schattenpriester-Set berücksichtigt jetzt nur noch auslaufende Debuffs auf deinem Target, wenn diese von dir sind (falls mehrere Priester in der Gruppe sind).
			- Es ist jetzt möglich bestehende Auren zu bearbeiten.
			  Unter "Auren verwalten" findest du unter den einzelnen Auren zusätzlich zu "Aktivieren"/"Deaktivieren" die Option "Bearbeiten".
			  Darunter kannst du die in der Aura enthaltenen Bedingungen einzeln ändern und löschen sowie weitere Bedingungen hinzufügen. 
			  Eine Bedingung bearbeiten bzw. hinzuzufügen funktioniert genau wie beim Erstellen. Nur, dass du hier nur einmal Attribut, Operator und Wert festlegst (ist ja auch nur eine einzelne Bedingung).
			  Beim Bearbeiten von Ausgaben legst du einfach der Reihe nach die gewünschten Ausgaben neu fest. Genau wie beim Erstellen.
			  Wenn du eine Aura bearbeitest, ändert sich natürlich auch der Name der Aura (der setzt sich ja auch ihren Einzelteilen zusammen).
			- Es ist jetzt möglich bestehende Auren zu duplizieren.
			  Unter "Auren verwalten" findest du unter den einzelnen Auren zusätzlich die Option "Duplizieren". Damit wird eine neue Aura als Kopie der aktuellen erstellt.
			  Der neuen Aura ist "Kopie x" vorangestellt. Das Menü springt direkt zur duplizierten Aura.
			- Es ist ein neuer Wert zum Attribut "Ereignis" hinzugekommen: "Taste gedrückt". Dieses Ereignis wird bei jedem Tastendruck ausgelöst.
			- Es ist ein neues Attribut "Taste" hinzugekommen. Über dieses kann die gedrückte Taste bzw. Tastenkombination ausgewertet werden.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
Änderungen in Version 23.3

	SkuCore
		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- STRG + SHIFT + TAB für nicht ins Ziel nehmbare NPCs (Startgebiete) funktioniert jetzt wieder.

	SkuChat
		Neuerungen
			- Wenn andere Spieler von dir eingeladen werden möchten, können diese dich jetzt mit dem Wort "inv" anflüstern.
			  Wenn dich jemand mit "inv" anflüstert, wird dir das mitgeteilt.
			  Du kannst diese Person dann mit einem Slash-Befehl einladen: /sku invite


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
Änderungen in Version 23.2

	SkuCore
		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- Die Post wird jetzt wieder auch beim zweiten Öffnen korrekt geöffnet.

		Neuerungen
			- Das Audiomenü macht jetzt beim Vorlesen von Auktionen kurze Sprechpausen zwischen den Beträgen von "Kauf" und "Gebot".
			- Im Auktionshausmenü gibt es jetzt unter "Verkäufe" als ersten Punkt "Neue Auktion". Danach kommen dann wie bisher die laufenden Auktionen.
			  Unter "Neue Auktion" kannst du direkt Gegenstände in deinen Taschen verkaufen (statt ins Taschenmenü wechseln zu müssen). 
			  Es werden _nur_ Gegenstände aufgelistet, die verkaufbar sind. Jeder Gegenstand wird nur _einmal_ aufgelistet. Dahinter steht die Anzahl die du _insgesamt_ in allen Taschen hast.
			  Unter dem jeweiligen Gegestand findest du dann das bekannte Menü zum Erstellen einer Auktion.
			- Es gibt zwei neue Sortieroptionen für das AH: "Level absteigend", "Level aufsteigend"
			- Wenn im AH nach Level gefiltert oder sortiert wird, enthält die Liste der Auktionen nun das Level des Gegenstands hinter jedem Gegenstandsnamen.
			- Filter und Sortierung werden jetzt bei jedem Öffnen des AHs zurückgesetzt.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
Änderungen in Version 23.1

	SkuCore
		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- Die Abfragegeschwindigkeit im Auktionshaus wurde gesenkt, um das "Aufhängen" zu vermeiden. Bitte melden, wenn es weiter hängt.
			- Die Tooltips bei Items passen jetzt.
			- Den Tooltips in den Taschen wurden Auktionsdaten hinzugefügt.
			- Wie Wortlängen von neuen Wörtern wurden korrigiert.
			- Es wird jetzt nicht mehr immer wieder zum Taschenplatz 3 sondern zum korrekten Taschenplatz zurückgegangen.
			- Die Händler funktioniert wieder.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
Änderungen in Version 23

	Achtung: Es gab nicht nur neue Features wie das Auktionshaus, sondern auch erhebliche interne Optimierungen am Menü.	Fehler sind möglich bzw. wahrscheinlich. Bitte alles testen und Fehler melden. Danke!

	SkuCore
		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- Das Post-Menü springt jetzt nicht mehr zum ersten Menüpunkt, wenn man einen noch ungelesenen Brief auswählt.
			- Das Taschen-Menü springt jetzt bei einem Klick nicht mehr immer wieder zum ersten Taschenplatz, sondern bleibt auf dem aktuellen Taschenplatz.

		Neuerungen
			- Unter "SkuCore > Auktionshaus" kannst du jetzt das Auktionshaus verwenden.
			- Das Auktionshaus-Menü enthält die folgenden Untermenüs:
				- Auktionen: Das sind die Auktionen im AH. Es wird nur angezeigt, wenn an einem Auktionator stehst und das Auktionsfenster offen ist.
					Darunter findest du als ersten Punkt "Filter und Sortierung", unter dem du Filtereinstellungen machen kannst.
					Dann kommen die einzelnen Auktionskategorien und darunter jeweils Unterkategorien und Unter-Unterkategorien (falls es diese gibt).
					Darunter findest du dann die eigentlichen Auktionen.
					Die Daten der Auktionen werden vom Server abgefragt. Das kann bei großen Kategorien (z. B. "Verbrauchsmaterialien") eine ganze Weile dauern (zwischen 0 und 30-60 Sekunden).
					Solange die Abfrage läuft, und noch keine Daten vorhanden sind, wird dir "Warten auf Abfrage" angezeigt. Es wird gleichzeitig ein Sound abgespielt.
					Sobald die Abfrage abgeschlossen ist, verschwindet "Warten auf Abfrage" und es wird automatisch die erste Auktion der Kategorie angezeigt.
					Mehrere Auktionen mit identischem Gegenstand, Preis und Stack werden zusammengefasst. Dann steht in der Liste z. B. "5 mal ...".
				- Gebote: Das sind die laufenden Auktionen auf die du geboten hast. 
				  	Sofern du mindestens einmal bei einem Auktionator warst, kannst du diese Liste auch unterwegs einsehen. Aber natürlich ist die Liste in diesem Fall möglicherweise nicht mehr aktuell.
				- Verkäufe: Das sind deine laufenden Verkaufsauktionen. 
				  	Sofern du mindestens einmal bei einem Auktionator warst, kannst du diese Liste auch unterwegs einsehen. Aber natürlich ist die Liste in diesem Fall möglicherweise nicht mehr aktuell.
				- Offline Datenbank: Das sind alle Auktionen aus dem AH, die du dir auch dann ansehen kannst, wenn du nicht an einem Auktionator stehst.
					Bei jedem Öffnen des Auktionshauses werden alle Auktionen gescannt und für die Offline Datenbank gespeichert. Dieser Scan ist jedoch nur alle 15 Minuten möglich.
					Je länger der letzte Scan her ist, desto weniger aktuell sind die Offlinedaten logischerweise.
					Und natürlich kannst du über die Offlinedaten nichts kaufen. Sie dienen nur der Information.
					Die Offlinedaten werden pro Fraktion pro Server gespeichert. Alle Allianz-Chars auf einem Server teilen sich also eine Datenbank. Genauso alle Hordler.
				- Offline Datenbank aktualisieren: Damit kannst du an einem Auktionator die Offline Datenbank manuell aktualisieren (wie gesagt, geht nur alle 15 Minuten).
			- KAUFEN: Du wählst im AH eine Kategorie und dann eine Auktion aus. Dann gehst du nach rechts gehst und wählst "Kaufen" oder "Bieten" aus.
			  Dann gehst du wieder nach rechts und wählst die Anzahl Auktionen aus, auf die du kaufen/bieten möchtest (falls es die Auktion mehrmals gab).
			  Dann drückst du ENTER. Dann wirst du aufgefordert ENTER zur Bestätigung oder ESCAPE zum Abbrechen zu drücken (mehrmals, wenn du mehr als einen ausgewählst hast). Wenn du ENTER drückst, kaufst/bietest du.
			- VERKAUFEN: Du verkaufst aus deinem Taschenmenü heraus ("Lokal > ...").
			  Jeder Gegenstand in deinen Taschen hat jetzt zusätzlich zu "Linksklick" und "Rechtsklick" noch ein "Verkaufen" Untermenü. Dieses wird nur angezeigt, wenn das Auktionsfenster offen ist.
			  Im Verkaufen-Menü gehst du wie bei der Aura-Erstellung immer weiter nach rechts und legst so die Parameter für die Auktion fest. Zum Schluss kommt die Laufzeit. Da drückst du dann EINGABE, und die Auktion wird erstellt.
			- Historische Auktionshausdaten: Bei jedem Scan und jeder Suche im Auktionshauses werden die Daten in einer Datenbank mit historischen Daten gespeichert. Auch dies geschieht pro Fraktion pro Server.
			  Die historischen Daten aus dieser Datenbank (Durchschnittspreis, niedrigster/höchster Preis, Preistendenz etc.) werden dir zu jedem Gegenstand im Tooltip angezeigt.
			  Die Daten sind natürlich erst dann wirklich aussagekräftig, wenn du über mehrere Tage oder Wochen hinweg mindestens einmal täglich das AH gescannt hast.
			- Die "Gebote"- und "Verkäufe"-Listen berücksichtigen zurzeit nur maximal 50 Einträge.
			  Darauf, was passiert, wenn du gleichzeitig auf mehr als 50 Auktionen bietest oder mehr als 50 Verkäufe laufen hast, bin ich selbst gespannt. :)

	SkuAuras
		Neuerungen
			- Aufgrund weiterer Änderungen am Aura-System werden erneut einmalig alle bestehenden Auren gelöscht. Mindestens eine weitere Komplettlöschung in einer der nächsten Versionen ist wahrscheinlich.
			- Es wurden (hoffentlich) diverse Fehler behoben. Zum Bespiel bei fehlenden Benachrichtigungen, wenn man sich selbst im Ziel hat.
			- Es sind 5 Sounds hinzugekommen ("Trompete", "Glas", "Tropfen"), die es in jeweils 5 verschiedenen Tonhöhen gibt.
			- Es sind 24 Sounds hinzugekommen ("Hinweis 1-24"), die es jeweils nur in einer Tonhöhe gibt.
			- Das Aura-Set für Schattenpriester wurde überarbeitet und verwendet jetzt weniger nervige Sounds.
			  Für Vampirumarmung, Schattenwort: Schmerz und Vampirberührung wird derselbe Sound verwendet. Jedoch in drei unterschiedlichen und klar zu unterscheidenden Tonhöhen.
			  Die Sounds werden ausgelöst, wenn einer der drei Dots auf deinem Ziel ausläuft oder wenn du das Ziel wechselst.

	SkuNav
		Neuerungen
			- Die Routendatenbank enthält jetzt standardmäßig die Daten aus Macs Version "V22Plus-11-AlleKarten-2022-01-16.txt"

		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- Der Feststecken-Sound wird jetzt parallel zu allen Anderen Audioausgaben ausgegeben und bricht andere Ausgaben nicht mehr ab.
			- Die kaputte Zone "Auchindoun" wurde repariert.
			- "Schmiedevaters Grabmal" und "Schwarzfelsspitze" gehören jetzt zur brennenden Steppe.
			- Die Darstellung der Sku-Minimap wurde optimiert. Sie wird jetzt weniger häufig gerendert wenn mehr Punkte und Links anzuzeigen sind (beim Rauszoomen).
			  Bei sehr weitem Rauszoomen ist es immer noch enorm ruckelig. Aber immerhin friert der Client jetzt nicht mehr vollkommen ein. :)


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
Änderungen in Version 22.7

	SkuAuras
		Neuerungen
		- Es zwei Attribute für Bedingungen: 
			- Im Kampf (wahr/falsch)
			- Ziel-Einheit angreifbar (wahr/falsch)

		Änderungen am Aura-Set Schattenpriester
			- Die Aura für Schattenschild wurde entfernt, da es sich um eine Troll-Rassenfähigkeit für Priester handelt.
			- Die Auren für den Cooldown von Gedankenschlag und Vampirberührung sind jetzt standardmäßig deaktiviert.
			- Die Dot-Auren für "Schattenwort: Schmerz", "Vampirberührung" und "Vampirumarmung" melden jetzt das Auslaufen auf dem aktuellen Target, statt auf allen Gegnern.
			- Es wurden drei weitere Auren hinzugefügt, die beim Zielwechsel im Kampf melden, wenn das neue Ziel keinen Dot "Schattenwort: Schmerz", "Vampirberührung" oder "Vampirumarmung" hat.

		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- Beim Attribute "Ziel" werden jetzt alle Ziele geprüft, nicht nur das erste Zutreffende (z. B. wenn eine Bedingung für den Spieler gilt, und dieser sich selbst im Target hat).


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
Änderungen in Version 22.6

	SkuAuras
		Neuerungen
			- Es gibt jetzt unter "SkuAuras > Auren > Aura Sets verwalten" ein erstes Aura-Set für Schattenpriester. 
			  Welche Buffs/Debuffs, Cooldowns etc. enthalten sind, steht im Tooltip des Sets (SHIFT + PFEIL RUNTER).
			  Bitte ausprobieren und Feedback geben. Danke.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
Änderungen in Version 22.5

	SkuOptions
		Neuerungen
			- Die Übersichtsseite zeigt jetzt für Gildenmitglieder zusätzlich deren aktuelle Zone an.
			- Die Übersichtsseite zeigt jetzt deine Buffs und Debuffs an.

		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- Die Übersichtsseite verursacht jetzt in Istanzen keinen Fehler mehr.
			- Die Übersichtsseite verursacht jetzt keinen Fehler mehr, wenn du sie öffnest ohne vorher mindestens einmal deine Taschen geöffnet zu haben.

	SkuAuras
		Neuerungen
			- Da es Änderungen am Aura-System gab, werden alle bestenden Pre-22.5-Auren beim ersten Einloggen mit 22.5 gelöscht.
			- Die Aura-Erstellung kann jetzt erst mit ENTER abgeschlossen werden, wenn mindestens "Aktion" und eine Ausgabe ausgewählt wurden. Drückst du vorher ENTER, so geht es einfach normal in das nächste Untermenü (wie bei PFEIL RECHTS).
			- Den ersten Parameter "Typ" einer Aura (war bisher "Einheit", "Gegenstand", "Zauber" oder "Aura") gibt es nicht mehr.
			  Stattdessen lauten die Werte für den ersten parameter nun "Wenn" und "Wenn nicht".
			  Das heißt, du wählst jetzt im ersten Schritt einer Aura aus, ob die Aura ausgelöst werden soll, wenn alle Bedingungen zutreffen oder alle Bedigngungen nicht zutreffen.
			- Einheiten-IDs werden jetzt von der "größten" zur "kleinsten" ausgewertet: Alle, Raid, Gruppe, Ziel, Spieler
			- Wird ein Attribut in einer Aura mehrmals verwendet, so gilt jetzt für die identischen Attribute automatisch der Operator "Oder". Beispiel: "wenn zauber name gleich machtwort seelenstärke oder zauber name gleich heiliges wort seelenstärke ..."
			  Für alle anderen Attribute der Aura gilt weiter automatisch der Operator "Und". Beispiel: "wenn ereignis gleich aura erhalten und zauber name gleich machtwort seelenstärke oder zauber name gleich heiliges wort seelenstärke
			- Neue Attribute: 
				- "Buff Liste Ziel" und "Debuff Liste Ziel", mit denen du in Bedingungen prüfen kannst, ob dein Ziel einen bestimmten Buff oder Debuff hat.
				- "Verfehlen Typ" enthält bei einem Verfehlen-Ereignis den genauen Typ (Ausweichen, Parieren etc.).
			- Neue Operatoren: 
				- "enthält" und "enthält nicht" (z. B. zur Verwendung mit "Buff Liste")
			- Neue Werte: 
				- Ereignis "Zielwechsel". Tritt immer auf, wenn eine bekannte Einheit ("player", "target", "party1-4" usw.) sein Ziel wechselt.
			- Neue Ausgabeattribute: 
				-"Eigene Ressource" (Mana, Wut, Energie) und "Eigene Gesundheit". Beides sind Prozentwerte.

		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- Das Attribut "Ziel" wurde nicht korrekt ausgewertet. Das wurde behoben.
			- Vergessene Debug-Ausgaben beim Auraerstellen wurden entfernt.
			- "Alle" bei "Qeuell Einheit" und "Ziel Einheit" gilt jetzt wirklich füer alle.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
Änderungen in Version 22.4

	SkuAuras
		Neuerungen
			- Das SkuAuras-Modul ist jetzt in seiner Grundfunktion fertig und kann getestet werden. 
			  Warnung: Fehler sind zwar nicht bekannt, aber wahrscheinlich. Es kann daher gut sein, dass wir die jetzt erstellten Auren später noch mal löschen müssen.
			  Sollten euch weitere Attribute, Ereignisse oder Werte einfallen, die in Auren für Bedigungen verwenden möchtet, dann her damit.
			- Alle Auren werden fest pro Char gespeichert.
			- Auren können deaktiviert werden, wenn du sie gerade nicht verwenden möchtest. Neue Auren sind standardmäßig aktiviert.
		  	- Unter "SkuAuras > Auren" findest du folgende Untermenüpunkte:
			  - Neue Aura: Funktioniert wie bisher. Du kannst dir jedoch zu jedem Schritt der Aura-Zusammenstellung mit SHIFT + PFEIL RUNTER Detailinformationen anzeigen lassen.
			    Zum Beispiel, welches Element du gerade auswählst und was der aktuelle Wert bedeutet.
				 Außerdem siehst du darunter welche Attribute und Werte du für die Aura schon ausgewählt hast.
				 Im letzten Schritt der Erstellung (die Werte für die Ausgabe), nach "Aktion dann", entscheidest du dich jetzt zuerst für eine Chat- oder Audioausgabe. 
				 Danach kannst du wie bisher beliebig viele Parameter und jetzt auch Sounds in die Ausgabe aufnehmen. 
				 Die Sounds sind dieselben wie bei der Fehler-Funktion. Sie werden im Menü zur Verdeutlichung jeweils abspielt, wenn du den Menüpunkt auswählst. 
				 Wenn ihr weitere Sounds benötigt, gebt mir bitte welche. Oder sagt mir alternativ genau, was für Sounds ihr möchtet.
			  - Auren verwalten: Hier findest du die drei Untermenüs "Aktivierte", "Deaktiviert" und "Alle". Darunter findest du die entsprechenden Auren.
			    Unter der jeweiligen Aura findest du jeweils Optionen, um die entsprechende Aura zu aktivieren/deaktivieren, zu bearbeiten (noch nicht implementier), zu löschen oder zu exportieren.
			  - Aura importieren: Selbsterklärend. Eine Aura aus einer externen Textdatei importieren. Das Importieren und Exportieren funktioniert genauso wie bei den Routen.
			  - Alle Auren löschen: Ohne weitere Nachfrage werden alle deine Auren gelöscht.
			  - Aura Sets verwalten: Noch nicht implementiert.
			  - Aura Sets importieren: Noch nicht implementiert.

	SkuOptions
		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- Das Menü wird jetzt nicht mehr beim Zielwechsel automatisch geschossen.
			- Aufgrund eines unbemerkten Zeichensatzproblems hat die Audioausgabe bisher viele Wörter mit Umlauten falsch ausgesprochen. Daher wurden 12000 Wörter neu aufgenommen.
			- Außerdem wurden 1000 fehlende Wörter aufgenommen.

	SkuQuest
		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- Für die Quest "Lar'korwis Fährte" sind jetzt die Weibchen als Ziele vorhanden.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
Änderungen in Version 22.3

	SkuOptions
		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- Die Eingabe im Menü ist immer noch schnell, aber alle dadurch entstandenen Fehler sollten behoben sein (Einfügen beim Import, Tasten zuweisen etc.).


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
Änderungen in Version 22.1

	SkuAuras
		Neuerungen
			- Das SkuAuras-Modul ist jetzt in einer ersten Testversion funktionsfähig. 
			  Es geht aber nur darum das grundlegende Konzept zu testen. Es ist nicht für den Einsatz geeignet oder gedacht.
			  Dieses Konzept sieht folgendermaßen aus:
			  	- Unter "SkuAuras > Neu" kannst du beliebig viele "Auren" neu definieren. Auren sind quasi einzelne kleine Beobachtungselemente, die bei bestimmten Dingen aktiv werden.
				  Eine definierte "Aura" hat einen oder mehrere Auslöser, Bedingungen und Aktionen. (Wie bei WeakAuras.)
			     Tritt der definierte Auslöser einer Aura ein, und treffen die definierten Bedingungen der Aura zu, dann werden die Aktionen der Aura ausgeführt.
				  Auslöser: Das sind Ereignisse wie "Buff/Debuff erhalten", "Gegenstand benutzt", "Zauber-Cooldown startet" usw.
				  Bedingungen: Das können Dinge die "Zaubername", "Gegenstandsname", "Ziel" etc. sein.
				  Aktionen: Damit kannst du dir entweder einen Hinweis als Audio oder im Chat ausgeben lassen. Inklusive was gerade ausgelöst wurde usw.
				- So funktioniert die Erstellung:
			  	  	- Zuerst wählst du unter "Neu" einen der vier Grundtypen für Auren aus: 
						- Einheit: Das sind Auren, die sich auf Informationen von Spielern, NPCs und Mobs beziehen. Beispiel: "Ansagen wenn HP des Spielers unter 50 % fällt".
						- Zauber: Das sind Auren, die sich auf Informationen zu Zaubern beziehen. Beispiel: "Ansagen wenn der Cooldown von Eisblock beendet ist".
						- Gegenstand: Diese Auren beziehen sich auf Gegenstände. Beispiel: "Ansagen wenn der Cooldown von Insignie beendet ist".
						- Aura: Das sind Auren, die sich auf Buffs und Debuffs (übergreifend als Auren bezeichnet) beziehen. Beispiel: "Ansagen, wenn Seelenstärke auf einem Gruppenmitglied der Spielers ausläuft".
					  Wähle einfach den Typ aus der Liste und geh mit der PFEILTASTE nach rechts in das nächste Untermenü.
					  WICHTIG: In diesem Menü haben die Tasten ENTER und PFEIL RECHTS/LINKS unterschiedliche Funktionen. Bewege dich immer mit den Pfeilen. ENTER schließst die Erstellung ab.
					- Nach dem Aura-Typ gehst du im Menü nach rechts und legst du eine oder mehrere Bedingungen fest.
						Eine Bedingung besteht immer aus drei Elementen:
							- Attribut: Die Eigenschaft, auf die sich die Bedingung bezieht. Beispiele: Zaubername, Aura-Typ (Buff oder Debuff), Ereignistyp
							- Operator: Der Vergleich, der für den aktuellen Attributtyp mit dem von dir definierten Wert vorgenommen wird. Beispiele "gleich", "ungleich", "größer", "kleiner"
							- Wert: Der Wert, der über den Operator mit dem aktuellen Wert des Attributs verglichen wird.
						Ein Beispiel für eine Bedingung aus diesen drei Elementen: "Attribut" ist "Zaubername", "Operator" ist "gleich" und "Wert" ist "Arkane Intelligenz". Das ergibt die fertige Bedingung "Wenn Zaubername gleich Arkane Intelligenz".
						Du musst also zuerst ein Attribut auswählen. Dann gehst du nach rechts und wählst einen Operator aus. Dann gehst du nach rechts und wählst einen Wert aus. 
						Damit ist die erste Bedingung erstellt. Wenn du wieder nach rechts gehst, kommen wieder die Attribute und du könntest eine weitere Bedingung (aus den drei Elementen) für die Aura festlegen.
					- Wenn du keine weiteren Bedigungen festlegen möchtest, musst du nun noch die Aktion festlegen, die ausgeführt werden woll, wenn alle Bedigungen zutreffen.
						Dazu wählst du in der Attributliste das Attribut "Aktion" aus und gehst erneut nach rechts.
						Dann findest du alle Aktionen, die verfügbar sind (z. B. Audioausgabe, Chatausgabe).
						Nach der Auswahl der Aktion gehst du erneut nach rechts. Im folgenden Untermenü findest du alle Attributwerte, die du zusätzlich ausgeben kannst. Beispiel: Bei einem Zauber "Zaubername", "Ziel" etc.
						Wähle einen zusätzlich auszugebenenden Attributwert aus. Wenn du erneut nach rechts gehst, kommen wieder alle Attributwerte, und du kannst einen weiteren Attributwert für die Ausgabe auswählen.
					- Wenn du den Aura-Typ, mindestens eine Bedingung (Attribut, Operator, Wert) und eine Aktion festlegt hast, kannst du die Erstellung der neuen Aura jederzeit abschließen.
						Zum Abschließen der Erstellung der Aura drückst du einfach ENTER.


	SkuNav
		Neuerungen
			- Ab sofort werden beim ersten Anmelden mit einer veralteten Version (vor 22) die Routendaten automatisch mit den jeweils aktuellen Routendaten überschrieben (statt die veralteten einfach nur zu löschen).
			  Du musst also nicht mehr zwingend Daten importieren.  Du kannst natürlich trotzdem weiterhin Routendaten importieren, falls es neue Daten gibt, und du nicht auf die nächste Addonversion mit neueren Daten warten möchtest.
			- Mit dem neuen Slash-Befehl "/sku rdatareset" kannst du nun die Routendaten im aktuellen Profil jederzeit auf die jeweils aktuellen (zum Zeitpunkt der Addon-Version) im Addon enthaltenen Routendaten zurücksetzen.

		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- Die Schnellwegpunkte funktionieren jetzt wieder wie gewohnt.
			
	SkuQuest
		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- Echeyakee erscheint jetzt als normaler Wegpunkt und sollte auch als Ziel für die Quest angezeigt werden.
			- Aus irgendeinem Grund waren bei Questzielen Gegenstände die aus Objekten droppen auf die aktuelle Zone beschränkt. Das wurde behoben.
			  Die Quest "Gestohlene Beute" sollte jetzt z. B. korrekt Questziele anzeigen.
			- Für "Beschmutzt durch Satyrn" ist jetzt korrekt die erforderlich Pre-Quest "Allianzbeziehungen" (Teil 2) aus OG eingetragen.
			- Für "Martek der Verbannte" wurden die Quests "Salziges Gift" und "Gehärtete Schalen" als Pre-Quest eingetragen. Ich weiß nicht, ob das stimmt. Aber die Wowhead-Kommentare behaupten es.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
Änderungen in Version 22

		Allgemein
			Das alte Routensystem wurde entfernt. Es gibt nun keine vordefinierten, langen Routen über mehrere Wegpunkte mehr.
			Stattdessen gibt es jetzt nur noch sehr viele Einzelverbindungen (Links) zwischen jeweils zwei einzelnen Wegpunkten. Aus diesen werden alle Routen dynamisch berechnet (Metarouten).
			Beim Verwenden von Routen ändert sich nicht viel, da ihr eh immer nur dynamisch erstellte Metarouten verwendet habt ("Route folgen").
			Durch die Entferung dieser Altlast konnte ich jedoch die Performance des Addons erheblich optimieren.
			Darum ist jetzt kein Cachen mehr notwendig. Lags in Menüs sollte nicht mehr vorkommen (bzw. nur in minimalem Umfang). Import und Export sind erheblich schneller.
			Beim ersten Verwenden eines Profils mit Version 22 oder höher werden alle (nun veralten) Wegpunkte und Routen aus dem Profil gelöscht.
			Du musst danach die aktuellen Routen und Wegpunkte mit der neuen einzelnen Routendatei von Mac neu importieren.

		SkuNav
			Neuerungen/Änderungen
				- Der Import und Export von Wegpunkten/Routen wurde verändert.
				  Es gibt nur noch eine Import- und eine Export-Funktion für die gesamte Welt. Es ist nicht mehr möglich Zonen oder Kontinente einzeln zu ex- oder importieren.
				  Beim Import werden grundsätzliche alle vorhandenen Wegpunkt- und Routendaten gelöscht und durch die importierten Daten ersetzt. Es wird nicht mehr additiv importiert.
				  Es werden beim Import nur noch Daten akzeptiert, die mit Version 22 oder höher erstellt wurden. Beim Import alter Routendaten meckert das Addon und ignoriert diese.
				- Optionen wie "Route folgen", "Nahe Route" etc. zeigen ab sofort alle Wegpunkten bzw. über das Routennetz erreichbaren Ziele auf dem gesamten Kontinent an.
				- Bei der Routenauswahl sagt das Addon nun bis zu einer Entfernung von 3000 Metern bzw. 200 abzulaufenden Routenpunkten zum Ziel die tatsächliche Entfernung an.
				  Alles darüber wird nur noch mit "Weit" statt mit "x Meter" angesagt. 
				  Wenn dir eine Route als "Weit" angesagt wird, kannst du sie aber natürlich trotzdem normal auswählen und ablaufen - wenn du wirklich einer so langen Route folgen willst. :)
				- Da es keine Routen mehr gibt, sind alle Menüpunkte zur Routenerstellung und -verwaltung aus dem Audiomenü entfernt worden.
				- "SkuNav > Route" wurde in "SkuNav > Route folgen" umbenannt. Darin landet ihr nun direkt bei "Ziele Entfernung" und "Einheiten Route".
				- Die "Nahe Routen"-Funktion (bei Questzielen und dem Auswählen von Einzelwegpunkten) wurde dank der Umstellung deutlich optimiert und wählt nun erheblich bessere/nähere Routen aus.
				- Unter "Wegpunkt > Auswählen" wurden die meisten Menüpunkte entfernt, da sie redundant waren.
				  Es gibt dort jetzt nur noch "Letzte", "Aktuelle Karte Entfernung", "Alle aktueller Kontinent" und "Aktuelle Karte Entfernung mit Auto".
				- Wenn du einer Einheiten-Route für sich bewegende NPCs folgst, sagt das Addon nun, wenn der Namensbalken des NPCs in deinem Sichtfeld erscheint bzw. dieses verlässt.
				  Dein Sichtfeld beträgt dabei ca. 20 Meter. Wenn du "xyz sichbar" hörst, dann bedeutet das also nicht, dass der NPC vor dir steht. Nur, dass er irgendwo in bis zu 20 Meter Entfernung ins Bild gekommen ist.

		SkuOptions
			Neuerungen/Änderungen
				- Es gibt einen neuen Slash-Befehl: /sku chatcover
				  Damit kannst du den Chat beim Streamen mit einem schwarzen Rechteck verdecken kannst. Erneutes /sku chatcover schalte die Verdeckung wieder aus.


		Versionshinweise nur für Mac/Routenersteller
			Neuerungen/Änderungen 
				- Der schwarze Textbalken für das Menü oben ist jetzt zweizeilig.
				- Es ist ab sofort möglich und von Vorteil alle Zonen miteinander zu verbinden. Bitte keine Lücken mehr an den Übergängen lassen.
				- Im Ausklappmenü der Sku-MM gibt es jetzt ein Dropdown-Feld, um die Zone(n) für die angezeigten Wegpunkte auszuwählen (Standard: "Aktuelle Zone").
				- Der Filter im Ausklappmenü der Sku-MM ist jetzt standardmäßig aus.
				- Die Belegung der Maustasten hat sich verändert. Die neue Belegung lautet folgendermaßen:
					MAUS LINKS + STRG + SHIFT + HALTEN: WP verschieben
					MAUS RECHTS + STRG: Polygon-Punkt setzen (sofern Polygon-Aufzeichnung läuft)
					MAUS MITTEL + STRG: Routen-Aufzeichnung starten/beenden
					MAUS MITTEL + STRG + SHIFT: Route löschen starten/beenden
					MAUS MITTEL + STRG + ALT: Alle Kommentare vom Wegpunkt löschen
					MAUS 4 + STRG: Kleinen Wegpunkt an Klickposition setzen
					MAUS 4 + STRG + SHIFT: Großen Wegpunkt an Klickposition setzen
					MAUS 5 + STRG: Wegpunkt löschen
					STRG + SHIFT + P: Großen Wegpunkt an Char-Position setzen
					STRG + SHIFT + O: Großen Wegpunkt an Char-Position setzen
				- Die Routenaufzeichnung hat sich verändert. Wie gesagt gibt es ab sofort nur noch Einzelverbindungen (Links) zwischen je zwei Wegpunkten.
					- Einen einzelnen Link erstellen:
						Du klickst einen Wegpunkt mit MAUS MITTEL + STRG an, um den Wegpunkt A für einen neuen Link auszuwählen.
						Dann klickst du einen weiteren Wegpunkt mit MAUS MITTEL + STRG an, um den Wegpunkt B für die neue Verbindung auszuwählen. Damit ist der Link erstellt.
					- Viele Links über eine längere Strecke erstellen:
						Solange du nur Punkt A für einen neuen Link angeklickt hast, bist du im "Aufzeichnungsmodus".
						In diesem kannst du dann wie gewohnt laufen und STRG + SHIFT + P/O weitere Wegpunkte erstellen - statt direkt den Punkt B für einen einzelnen Link anzuklicken.
						Solange du im Aufzeichnungsmodus bist, wird jeder neu erstellte Wegpunkt automatisch mit dem Vorherigen verlinkt.
						Zum Schluss beendest du den Aufzeichnungsmodus, indem du mit der Maus auf einen bestehenden Wegpunkt für den letzten Link klickst.
					- Einen einzelnen Link löschen:
						Du kannst immer nur einen Link löschen, indem du mit MAUS MITTEL + STRG + SHIFT auf einen Punkt A und dann erneut mit MAUS MITTEL + STRG + SHIFT auf einen Punkt B klickst.
						Gibt es einen Link zwischen den beiden Punkten, so wird dieser dann entfernt.
						Solltest du im oben beschriebenen Aufzeichnungsmodus für Links sein, wird das Klicken zum Löschen ignoriert.

			Fehlerkorrekturen
				- Die Karte für "Höhle der Nebel" wurde repariert.
				- Das Zonenauswahl-Dropdown in der Sku-MM wird zeigt jetzt nur noch 11 Elemente in der offenen Liste an, damit diese nicht mehr aus dem Bild ragt.

				- Das Zonenauswahl-Dropdown in der Sku-MM wird jetzt nach einem Kontintentwechsel korrekt aktualisiert
				- Das Menü "Kommentar zuweisen" zeigt jetzt alle Wegpunkte des aktuellen Kontinents an.
				- Die Sku-MM geht jetzt nach dem Einloggen direkt mit dem ersten Drücken von STRG + SHIFT + F auf.
				- Ruinen von Lordaeron wurden endlich abgerissen und durch einen schicken Plattenbau ersetzt.
				- Höhlen des Wehklagens sowie Kral und Hügel der Klingenhauer wurden repariert.

Änderungen in Version 21.14

	SkuNav
		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- Thrall ist wieder da. Er war nur Zigaretten holen, und hatte vergessen bescheid zu sagen.
			- Der Bereich (Südstrom) am Hinterausgang von Orgrimmar gehört jetzt zum Brachland.
			- Wegpunkte aus unterschiedlichen Zonen können jetzt verbunden werden ohne das was kaputt geht.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
Änderungen in Version 21.13

	SkuOptions
		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- Ein Fehler im Menü zur Wegpunktbenennung wurde behoben.

	SkuNav
		Neuerungen
			- Es gibt jetzt eine Funktion, um bei sich bewegenden NPCs deren Laufweg als Route abzulaufen und so nach ihnen zu suchen.
			  Du findest diese unter "SkuNav > Route > Route folgen > Einheiten Route".
			  In diesem Menü ist eine Liste aller NPCs aus der aktuellen Zone mit Laufwegen enthalten. Sortiert nach deiner Entfernung zum NPC.
			  Wenn du einen der NPCs auswählst, startet das Folgen einer normalen Metaroute über den Laufweg des ausgewählten NPCs.
			  Das Folgen der Route funktioniert wie bei allen anderen Routen auch.

		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- Ein Fehler bei verschobenen Standard-Wegpunkten auf der Sku-MM wurde behoben.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
Änderungen in Version 21.12

	SkuQuest
		Neuerungen
			- Wenn bei Quests Wegpunkte unter "Annahme", "Ziel" und "Abgabe" auf einem anderen Kontinent liegen, wird ab sofort nicht mehr nur "leer" angezeigt.
			  Stattdessen werden wie gewohnt die Wegpunkte als Untermenü angezeigt. 
			  Unter den Wegpunkten findest du dann aber nicht "Route", "Nahe Route" und "Wegpunkt" (das ist nicht möglich, denn das Ziel ist ja auf einem anderen Kontinent).
			  Stattdessen gibt es darunter nur einen Menüeintrag ohne Funktion, der dir sagt auf welchem Kontinent und in welcher Zone das Ziel liegt. Beispiel: "Anderer Kontinent Schwerbenwelt Höllenfeuerhalbinsel".

		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- Der "Solarsal Pavilion" in Feralas wurde für Quest "Die Ruinen von Solarsal" als Ziel eintragen.
			- Die vier Flammen und der Monolith in Feralas wurden als Ziele für die Quest "Der Stock von Equinex" eingetragen.
			- Stalvan Dunstmantel ist jetzt ein Questziel.
			- Die Quest "Das Geheimnis des Morgenkorns" in Feralas hat jetzt die Quest "Lebenshands Bitte" als Pre-Quest eingetragen.

	SkuNav
		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- Solange die Sku-Minimap offen ist, wird jetzt nicht mehr gecached. Das sollte die Performance der Sku-Minimap deutlich verbessern.
			- Weil Stalvan eine olle Petze ist, wurde gleich noch ein Problem mit vielen NPCs in Southshore in Hillsbrad behoben, die jetzt alle angezeigt werden.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
Änderungen in Version 21.11

	SkuCore
		Neuerungen
			- Das Jäger-Tierausbildungsfenster kann jetzt im Lokal-Menü verwendet werden.

	SkuOptions
		Neuerungen
			- Das Wort "Käfig" wurde zur Wortliste für Wegpunktnamen hinzugefügt.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
Änderungen in Version 21.10

	SkuNav
		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- STRG + SHIFT + I und STRG + SHIFT + U zur Routenerstellung wurden entfernt.

	SkuCore
		Neuerungen
			- Der Stallmeister für Jäger-Tiere kann jetzt über das Lokal-Menü benutzt werden.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
Änderungen in Version 21.9

	SkuNav
		Neuerungen
			- Wenn die Erreichen-Reichweite für Wegpunkte auf "Auto" steht, sagt das Addon jetzt bei jedem Wechsel auf 1 bzw 3 Meter die Worte "Nah" und "Weit".

		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- Die Holzschlundfeste gehört jetzt komplett zum Teufelswald.
			- Bei einem neuen Wegpunkt starten Beacons jetzt direkt mit einem Sound, statt wie bisher mit einer Pause.
			- Aber sofort sagt das Addon "Routen aktualisierung abgeschlossen", sobald das anfängliche Cachen der Routen beendet ist.
			- Das anfängliche Cachen von Routen wird jetzt korrekt fortgeführt bis der Cache erstellt ist.
			  Bisher wurde es ungewollte beim Folgen einer Route abgebrochen und nicht wieder neu gestartet.
			- Das Cachen wird nun dynamisch gesteuert und versucht möglichst schnell zu rechnen, die Frame-Rate des Spiels dabei aber nicht unter 35 sinken zu lassen. 
			  Sinkt die Frame-Rate durch den Cache-Vorgang unter 35, so wird der Cache-Prozess gedrosselt.
			  Er kann daher schwanken und, je nach Computer und Routenmenge, deutlich schneller oder langsamer als bisher sein. (Zwischen 30 Sekunden und 15 Minuten oder mehr.)

	SkuOptions
		Neuerungen
			- Der Wortliste für Wegpunktnamen wurden die Wörter "Rettung", "Hilfe" und "Punkt" hinzugefügt.
			- Es gibt einen neuen Slash-Befehl: /sku mmreset
			  Dieser setzt die Sku-Minimap auf ihre Ursprungsgröße zurück.

		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- Es wurde ein Fehler behoben, der für viele eigenartige Piepser in der Sprachausgabe bei eigentlich bekannten Worten verantwortlich war.

	SkuCore
		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- Es wurde ein unfassbar vertrackter Fehler behoben, der dafür verantwortlich war, dass bei Händlern unter Gegenständen mit einstelligen Preisen keine Preisangaben zu sehen waren. (Für diese Zeile waren 5 Stunden Arbeit erforderlich *knurr*)


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
Änderungen in Version 21.8

	SkuCore
		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- Einen Fehler im Menü "SkuCore > Entfernung" behoben. 
			  Solange die möglichen Entferungen nach dem Einloggen/Reload noch ermittelt werden (dauert bis zu 2 Minuten), wird jetzt unter "Freundlich", "Feindlich" und "Unbekannt" im Untermenü "leer" angezeigt.
			  Erst, wenn Entfernungen verfügbar sind (das Addon sagt "Neue Entfernungen verfügbar"), tauchen in dem Menü Einträge auf.
			- Beim Einstellen der Spiel-Tastenbelegungen auf die Sku-Standardeinstellungen ("SkuCore > Spiel Tastenbelegungen > Alles zurücksetzen") werden jetzt folgende Tastenkombinationen neu zugewiesen:
			  Kameraperspektiven:
			  	- STRG + NUMMERNBLOCK 7: Kamerperspektive 2 (nah, Ansicht geradeaus)
			   - STRG + NUMMERNBLOCK 8: Kamerperspektive 4 (weit entfernt, Ansicht von schräg oben)
			   - STRG + NUMMERNBLOCK 9: Kamerperspektive 5 (weit entfernt, Ansicht geradeaus)
			  Zielmarkierungen:
			  	- STRG + NUMMERNBLOCK 1: Totenkopf
			  	- STRG + NUMMERNBLOCK 2: X
			  	- STRG + NUMMERNBLOCK 3: Grünes Dreieck
			  	- STRG + NUMMERNBLOCK 4: Blaues Quadrat
			  	- STRG + NUMMERNBLOCK 5: Mond
			  	- STRG + NUMMERNBLOCK 0: Keine Markierung
			- Auf der Addon-Downloadseite steht ein Autohotkey-Skript zur Positionierung des Mauszeigers für diese Kameraperspektiven zur Verfügung. 
			  (sku_maus.zip)
			  Falls du nicht weißt, wie das mit den Autohotkey-Skripten geht, frag bitte jemanden.
			  Das Skript belegt die Tasten NUMMERNBLOCK 7-9.
			  Es sendet jeweils die Tastenkombination STRG + NUMMERNBLOCK 7-9 an das Spiel (und ruft so die passende Kameraperspektive auf, siehe oben). Dann positioniert es die Maus passend. Und dann klickt es.
			  Mit dem Autohotkey-Skript kannst du also künftig mit einem Tastendruck auf NUMMERNBLOCK 7-9 in drei verschiedenen Kameraperspektiven automatisch looten, Objekte einsammeln etc.

	SkuNav
		Neuerungen
			- Es gibt jetzt drei Einstellungen für die Reichweite in der ein Wegpunkt als erreicht gilt: 1, 3 und Auto.
			  Du kannst weiterhin mit STRG + SHIFT + Q zwischen "1 Meter" und "3 Meter" umschalten. Jetzt kommt nach 3 jedoch nicht wieder 1, sondern erst "Auto".
			  Bei der Einstellung "Auto" entscheidet das Addon anhand der Entferung zum nächsten Wegpunkt selbst, welche Entfernung für das Erreichen des Wegpunktes verwendet wird.
			  - Ist der nächste Wegpunkt 9 oder weniger Meter entfernt, so verwendet es "Erreichen bei 1 Meter".
			  - Ist der nächste Wegpunkt 14 oder mehr Meter entfernt, so verwendet es "Erreichen bei 3 Meter".

		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- Es sollten beim Import Wegpunkte berücksichtigt werden, die aktualisierte Kommentare haben.
			  Wenn du also über einen bestehenden Wegpunkt den identischen erneut importierst, und diese einen Kommentar bekommen hat, so sollte diese neue Kommentar importiert werden.
			  Diese Funktion muss gründlich getestet werden.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
Änderungen in Version 21.7

	SkuCore
		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- Ein Fehler mit installierten Addons und Tastenbelegungen wurde behoben.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
Änderungen in Version 21.6

	SkuCore
		Neuerungen
			- Über "SkuCore > Spiel Tastenbelegung" kann man nun die Tastenbelegungen für alle Funktionen in WoW festlegen/ändern.
			  Die Nutzung ist quasi mit der Tastenbelegung für Aktionsleisten identisch.
			  Achtung: Die Funktion überprüft nicht, ob eine neue Tastenkombination bereits für andere Funktionen verwendet wird. Das musst du selbst überblicken.
			  Sollte die Tastenkombination bereits für andere Funktionen verwendet werden, so wird sie dort kommentarlos entfernt.
			  Es gibt außerdem unter "Spiel Tastenbelegung > Alles zurücksetzen" die Möglichkeit alle Tastenbelegungen auf die Standardtastenbelegungen zurückzusetzen. 
			  Dabei handelt es sich um die von _uns_ genutzten Standardtastenbelegungen. _Nicht_ um die normalen WoW-Standardtastenbelegungen.

		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- Das kleine ö kann jetzt Aktionsleisten zugeweisen werden.
			- ENTER wurde bei den Aktionsleisten als Tastenbelegung blockiert.

	SkuNav
		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- Es wurde ein Fehler bei identischen Routennamen behoben.
			  Einer neu erstellten Route wird ab sofort eine Nummer angehängt, sollte es den Namen schon geben.
			- Es wurde ein Fehler mit diversen Unterzonen vor Instanzen behoben (z. B. Düsterbruch draußen).
			- Das Rabenholdtanwesen hat eine gerichtliche Verfügung gegen die geplante Zuordnung zum Vorgebirge erwirkt. Es bleibt daher Teil des Alteracgebirges.
			- Beim Routenimport werden nun Routen, die bereits identisch (inkl. Zwischenwegpunkte) vorhanden sind, nicht mehr als Detailfehler ausgegeben.

	SkuOptions
		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- Ein fehlendes Leerzeichen bei der Audioausgabe hinter "Würfeln für" beim Würfeln wurde hinzugefügt.
			  Das Addon hat immer den Gegenstandsnamen direkt an das "für" angefügt. 
			  Das so entstehene Wort "für..." ohne Leerzeichen zwischen "für" und dem Gegenstandsnamen war natürlich unbekannt. Daher gab es dafür immer nur einen Piepser.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
Änderungen in Version 21.5

	SkuNav
		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- Vergessene Debug-Meldungen im Chat entfernt.

	SkuAuras
		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- Vergessene Debug-Infos im Tooltip entfernt.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
Änderungen in Version 21.4

	SkuNav
		Neuerungen
			- Im Hinterland wurden Fraktionszonen (Städte von Allianz und Horde) definiert, die beim Betreten angesagt werden.
			- Es gibt jetzt eine Funktion, um die laufende Route oder die zuletzt beendete Route umzukehren und diese zum Ausgangspunkt zurückzulaufen.
			  Du aktivierst die Rück-Folgen Funktion mit STRG + SHIFT + Z.
			- Bei der Wegpunktauswahl unter "SkuNav > Wegpunkt > Auswählen > Aktuelle Karte Entfernung" gibt es jetzt zusätzlich die Möglichkeit "Nahe Routen" zu einem Wegpunkt auszuwählen.
			  Daher wählst du jetzt nicht mehr einfach den Namen des Wegpunktes aus. Stattdessen gibt es unter jedem Wegpunkt ein weiteres Untermenü mit zwei Elementen:
				- Auswählen: Damit wählst du wie bisher einfach nur den Wegpunkt aus.
				- Nahe Routen: Damit landest du in einem weiteren Untermenü mit nahen Routen zum Wegpunkt. Dieses funktioniert genauso wie die schon bestehenden "Nahe Routen"-Menüs (z. B. bei den Quests).
			  Damit auch Schnellwegpunkte über Nahe Routen erreicht werden können (z. B. die Leiche), wurden die Schnellwegpunkte wieder mit in die Liste "Aktuelle Karte Entfernung" aufgenommen.

	SkuCore
		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- Es wurde ein Lua-Fehler behoben, der manchmal bei Ruhestein oder Portalen auftrat.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
Änderungen in Version 21.3

	SkuNav
		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- Fehler beim Einloggen mit geöffneter Sku-Minimap behoben.
			- Der Kartenfehler vor Onys Hort wurde behoben.

	SkuCore
		Neuerungen
			- Wer das SkuFluegel-Addon 5.4 hat, kann dich jetzt von sich aus mit einem Tastendruck auf Folgen setzen. Du kannst also AFK gehen. ;P

		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- Das Problem mit der unfreiwilligen Dauer-Drehung beim Öffnen des Menüs (z. B. beim Questlog, am Briefkasten etc.) wurde beseitigt.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
Änderungen in Version 21.2

	SkuNav
		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- Im Ausklappmenü der Sku-Minimap wurden die Filteroptionen bearbeitet. Sie filtern jetzt korrekt.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
Änderungen in Version 21.1

	SkuOptions
		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- Ein Fehler bei "SkuNav > Daten > Import nach Karte" wurde behoben, bei dem eine Menge Falschmeldungen zu Importfehlern angezeigt wurden.

	SkuNav
		Neuerungen
			Im Ausklappmenü der Sku-Minimap gibt es fünf neue Schalter, um die angezeigten Wegpunkte zu filtern. Diese dienen zur einfacheren Routenerstellung und sind nur für Mac interessant.
			- Filter (Standard aktiv): 
			  Schaltet das Filtern insgesamt an und aus. Wenn aktiviert, werden immer alle Wegpunkte gefiltert, die kein Quest-Start, -Ziel oder -Abgabe sind.
			  Custom-Wegpunkte und Wegpunkte mit Route werden niemals gefiltert.
			- Starts (Standard aktiv):
			  Zeigt bei _aktiviertem_ Filter alle Wegpunkte an, die ein Quest-Start sind.
			- Objectives (Standard aktiv):
			  Zeigt bei _aktiviertem_ Filter alle Wegpunkte an, die ein Quest-Ziel sind.
			- Finish (Standard aktiv):
			  Zeigt bei _aktiviertem_ Filter alle Wegpunkte an, die eine Quest-Abgabe sind.
			- Limit (Standard inaktiv):
			  Begrenzt die angezeigten Wegpunkte bei _aktiviertem_ Filter auf drei ersten pro Typ (z. B. "Verstörter Hölleneber 1-3").
			  Die ersten drei sind wie bisher die, die in rosa angezeigt werden.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
Änderungen in Version 21

	SkuAuras
		Neuerungen
			- Es gibt ein neues Modul im Menü: SkuAuras. Allerdings ist es noch ohne Funktion.

	SkuNav:
		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- Ein Fehler beim Löschen von Wegpunkten wurde behoben, durch den es nicht möglich war einen neuen Wegpunkt mit demselben Namen wie ein bereits gelöschter Wegpunkt zu erstellen.

		Neuerungen
			- Unter "SkuNav > Daten" gibt es einen neuen Menüpunkt "Alle Routen und Wegpunkte löschen". Dieser löscht ohne weitere Nachfrage alle Custom-Wegpunkte und Routen für die gesamte Welt. 
			  Danach hast du nur noch die jungfräuliche Wegpunkt- und Routen-Liste (also nur noch Standard-Wegpunkte). Wie nach einem Zurücksetzen des Profils.
			- In der SkuMinimap gibt es links im Ausklappmenü zwei neue Buttons:
				- Custom w/o: Zeigt auf der SkuMinimap nur noch die selbst erstellten Wegpunkte (rot) an, die nicht in einer Route verwendet werden.
				- Default w/o: Zeigt auf der SkuMinimap nur noch die Standard-Wegpunkte (rosa, grün, türkis) an, die nicht in einer Route verwendet werden.
				Bei beiden Buttons kannst du erneut auf den Button klicken, um zur Normaldarstellung zurückzukehren. Das passiert ebenfalls beim Schließen der SkuMinimap.
				Bei beiden Buttons wird zusätzlich im Textfeld darunter eine Liste der entsprechenden Wegpunktnamen ausgegeben. Die kannst du dir dann da raus kopieren.
			- Importfehler werden vorläufig einzeln im Chat ausgegeben, statt nur gezählt. Sollten welche auftauchen, musst du dich vor einem Export mit den Ursachen befassen. 
			  Rote Fehlermeldungen musst du unbedingt beheben. Gelbe solltest du überprüfen. Weiße sind nur zur Informationen und vermutlich kein Problem.

	SkuQuest
		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- Lady Jaina Prachtmeer ist nach Theramore zurückgekehrt. Sie war nur eben Bier holen.
			- Es wurden ein paar Haufen lockere Erde im Sumpfland hinzugefügt. Außerdem habe ich im Meer an der Küste eine warme Stelle gefunden.
			- Es wurde eine fehlende Information zu erforderlichen Pre-Quest in die Abfrage implementiert (Beispiel: "Graben in der Erde").

	SkuCore
		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- Die Entfernungseinstellungen werden jetzt gespeichert. Auch zwischen Spielesitzungen.
			  Da die entsprechenden Informationen vom Server abgerufen werden müssen, und dies zwischen 10 und 90 Sekunden dauern kann, ist die Entfernungsfunktion immer erst nach 10-90 Sekunden nach dem Anmelden verfügbar.
			  Bis dahin zeigt das Menü "Entfernung" nichts an, und es werden auch keine Reichweiten angesagt.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
Änderungen in Version 20.13

	SkuNav
		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- Einen Fehler mit "Rokaro;Champion der Horde;Feralas" behoben.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
Änderungen in Version 20.12

	SkuQuest
		Neuerungen
			- Ab sofort ist es für uns möglich eigene Korrekturen an der Questdatenbank vorzunehmen (statt nur die von Questie zu übernehmen.)
			  Den Anfang machen die Quests "Schlammpanzersuppe mit Käfern" ("Morgan Stern" ist keine erforderliche Pre-Quest mehr) und "Bergt die Fracht" (Ziel hinzugefügt).

	SkuNav
		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- Kaputte Routen in Importdaten konnten dafür sorgen, dass der Import für die aktuelle Zone mit einem Fehler abgebrochen wurde.
			  Das passiert jetzt nicht mehr. Die kaputten Routen werden beim Import entfernt.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
Änderungen in Version 20.11

	SkuMob
		Neuerungen
			- Bei gelben Gegnern (die einen nicht von sich aus angreifen), sagt das Addon jetzt "passiv" vor dem Namen.

	SkuCore
		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- Es wurde (hoffentlich) ein Fehler beim automatischen Folgen nach dem Kampf behoben.

	SkuOptions
		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- "Verwüstete Lande" zur Wortliste für Wegpunkte hinzugefügt.
			- Auch, wenn es niemand bemerkt hat, wurde ein Problem behoben, dass die Anzeige der Liste aller NPC-Wegpunkte unter SkuNav > Wegpunkt > Auswählen > Alle NPCs" verhindert hat.
			- Bei Filtern in Menüs werden Umlaute jetzt korrekt buchstabiert.

	SkuNav
		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- Alle Standardwegpunkte (beginnen mit "s;") in Feralas wurden gelöscht, da sie offensichtlich falsch waren.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
Änderungen in Version 20.10

	SkuQuest
		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- Vergessene Debug-Meldngen entfernt.

	SkuCore
		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- Fehler mit Dauer-Fehlermeldungen in Instanzen behoben.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
Änderungen in Version 20.9

	SkuQuest
		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- Es wurde in Fehler behoben, durch den Objekte und Gegenstände nicht unter "Abgabe" aufgeführt wurden.

	SkuCore
		Neuerungen
			- Es gibt jetzt eine Entfernungsansage für dein Ziel. Du findest sie unter "SkuCore > Entfernung".
			  Standardmäßig sind alle Entfernungsansagen aus.
			  Funktionsweise:
			  Die Entfernung wird damit nicht wirklich gemessen. Das ist nicht möglich. 
			  Stattdessen verwendet das Addon bestimmte Aktionen (Betrachten, Handeln etc.) und deine Zauber, um festzustellen welche davon für das Ziel funktionieren. 
			  Da das alles eine bestimmte Reichweite hat, kann es so zumindest gewisse Entfernungen erkennen.
			  Dieser "Trick" führt dazu, dass du die Entfernung immer nur in bestimmten Schritten ansagen kannst. Zum Beispiel, 5, 8, 15, 22, 30, 40 Meter.
			  Welche Entfernungen abgefragt/angesagt werden können, hängt von deinem Char, seinen Skill, seinen Zauber, seinen Gegenständen und vor allem vom Ziel ab (einen Feind kann man z. B. nicht anhandeln).
			  Im Menü unter "Entfernung" sind drei Kategorien für verschiedene Zieltypen: Freundlich, Feindlich, Unbekannt. 
			  Unter jeder Kategorie werden die Entfernungen aufgeführt, die du mit deinem aktuellen Char für die Kategorie messen kannst.
			  Unter den verschiedenen Entfernungen findest du dann jeweils ein Untermenü mit Sounds, die du abspielen kannst, wenn das Ziel in der entsprechenden Entfernung ist.
			  Mit "Gesprochen" wird die Entfernung alternativ von Hans als Zahl angesagt.
			  Achtung: Die messbaren Entfernungen können sich im Laufe der Zeit verändern. Wenn du z. B. einen neuen Zauber lernst. Oder ein Item zerstörst.
			  Wenn sich die Liste der messbaren Entfernungen verändert, sagt das Addon dies an.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
Änderungen in Version 20.8

	SkuCore
		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- Ein Fehler mit der Hochscrollen-Taste für Berufefenster wurde behoben.
			- Der Feststecken-Sound funktioniert jetzt auch wenn man rückwärts läuft.
			- Bei Briefen mit mehreren angehängten Gegenständen werden jetzt unter "Anhänge" alle angehängten Gegenstände und nicht nur der erste angezeigt.

		Neuerungen
			- Alle gesprochenen Fehler-Sounds sind jetzt zusätzlich in der männlichen Stimme "Hans" verfügbar (dem Namen ist jeweils "Hans" vorangestellt).
			- SkuCore kann jetzt über STRG + SHIFT + TAB auch NPCs anvisieren, die nicht anvisierbar sind (Startgebiete etc.).
			  Dazu übernimmt es dauerhaft die Tastenkombination STRG + SHIFT + TAB (war vorher "vorherigen Freund anvisieren").
			  Das Addon steuert das Anvisieren über die Namensbalken der NPCs. Du bekommst daher mit STRG + SHIFT + TAB immer den nächsten NPC aus allen
			  ins Ziel deren Namensbalken gerade sichbar sind. Das muss _nicht_ (wie beim normalen Anvisieren) ein NPC vor dir sein.
			  Außerdem werden die Namensbalken standardmäßig erst ab 20 Meter Entfernung eingeblendet. Das Anvisieren mit STRG + SHIFT + TAB hat also eine deutlich
			  kleinere Reichweite als das normale Anvisieren.
			  Du solltest auch weiterhin mit STRG + TAB das nächste freundliches Ziel anvisieren. Es sei denn, du bist in einem Startgebiet, und bekommst es damit nicht ins Ziel.
			  Dann kannst du jetzt die neue Funktion mit STRG + SHIFT + TAB verwenden.
			- Der Panikmodus ist wieder da!
			  Diesmal mit der Tastenkombination STRG + SHIFT + Y zur Aktivierung, einem ein Drittel leiseren Beacon, und der Titelmelodien aus "Der weiße Hai" im Hintergrund.
			  Ansonsten funktioniert er exakt so wie vorher. Hier die alte Beschreibung:
			    Die Panik-Taste versetzt das Addon in den Panikmodus bzw. schaltet diesen wieder aus.
			    Der Panikmodus ist für Situationen gedacht, in denen schnell du den Weg zurücklaufen möchtest, den du gekommen bist. Zum Beispiel, weil du aus einem Kampf fliehen möchtest.
			    Sobald du den Panikmodus gestartet hast, führt dich das Addon über ein dynamisch großzügig positioniertes Beacon über den Weg zurück, den du gekommen bist (bis zu 500 Meter).
			    Du erreichst das Beacon nie. Es gibt keine "Wegpunkt erreicht"-Plings. Sobald du bis auf 20 Meter an das Beacon herankommst, wir es automatisch auf den nächsten Punkt deiner Rücklaufstrecke gesetzt.
			    Sobald du aus dem Kampf kommst, endet der Panik-Modus automatisch.
			    Bei jeder Benutzung der Panik-Taste wird die aufgezeichnete Wegstrecke zurückgesetzt und beginnt ab deiner aktuellen Position.
			  Das mit dem weißen Hai war btw nur ein Witz.

	SkuOptions
		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- Ein angewendeter Filter wird jetzt korrekt entfernt, wenn man die Menüebene mit PFEIL LINKS verlässt.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
Änderungen in Version 20.7

	SkuNav
		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- Es wurde etwas am Cachen geändert.

	SkuCore
		Neuerungen
			- Es gibt einen neuen Menüpunkt "SkuCore > Optionen > Fehler Feedback".
			  In diesem Menü kannst du für acht verschiedene Fehlertypen Audiomeldungen einstellen:
			  - Nicht in Reichweite (Ziel ist zu weit entfernt für die Fähigkeit)
			  - Nicht in Bewegung (Fähigkeit kann nicht in Bewegung verwendet werden)
			  - Keine Sichtlinie (keine Sichtlinie zu Ziel)
			  - Ziel ungültig (Ziel ist nicht angreifbar)
			  - In kampf (Fähigkeit ist nicht im Kampf möglich)
			  - Ressource fehlt (Mana, Wut, Energie reicht nicht)
			  - Objekt beschäftigt (Interaktion mit Ziel nicht möglich, weil es von einer anderen Person verwendet wird)
			  - Richtung falsch (Ziel ist nicht vor dir)
			  - Gestunnt (du bist gestunnt und kannst die Fähigkeit nicht nutzen)
			  - Unterbrochen (die Fähigkeit wie z. B. ein Zauber wurde unterbrochen - von dir, einem Mob etc.)
		 	  Du kannst im Menü für jeden Fehlertyp einen Sound auswählen.
			  Dazu stehen Töne zur Verfügung (Beep, Wusch, Bonk etc.), und es gibt eine gesprochene Meldung (mit einer neuen Stimme) pro Fehlertyp ("Sichtlinie", "Bewegung", "Reichweite" etc.)
			  Wenn du im Untermenü für einen Fehlertyp durch die Sounds blätterst, wird der jeweilige Sound zu Demonstration abgespielt.
			  Außerdem kannst du ganz oben unter "Sound Kanal" den Kanal für diese Sounds auswählen.

		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- Die Infoseite wurde leicht verändert.
			  - Der eingestellte Plündertyp wurde unter den Abschnitt "Gruppe" verschoben.
			  - Alle Einzelzeilen wie Reparatur, Geld etc. wurden unter einen gemeinsamen Abschnitt "Allgemein" verschoben.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
Änderungen in Version 20.6

	SkuCore
		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- Lobet den Herrn, werft Blumen, opfert eure Erstgeborenen ... nach langer Fehlersuche funktioniert das Infofenster jetzt endlich normal. :)
			  Es geht, wie vorgesehen, zuverlässig beim Loslassen der Shift-Taste statt nach 30 Sekunden zu.
			- Außerdem mach das Infofenster jetzt beim Öffnen "Bing" und beim Schließen "Bong". Wie der Chat.

	SkuOptions
		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- Das TTS spricht jetzt "klammer auf/zu" im Text nur noch als "klammer" aus.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
Änderungen in Version 20.5

	SkuCore
		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- Die Meldung "Noch x" beim Erreichen eines Wegpunktes auf einer Route kann jetzt nicht mehr unerwünscht durch andere Audioausgaben abgebrochen/überschrieben werden.
			- Das Infofenster funktioniert nun auch, wenn man keine Ruhe-XP hat.
			- Die Gildenmitglieder im Infofenster werden jetzt bei jeder Anzeige des Fensters aktualisiert.
			  Da diese Informationen vom Server kommen, und nicht sofort verfügbar sind, kann es trotzdem sein, dass die Informationen nicht sekundengenau aktuell sind.

	SkuQuest
		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- Die Quest "Vahlarriels suche" wird jetzt korrekt im Questlog angezeigt.

	SkuOptions
		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- SHIFT und STRG haben bei der Anzeige von Detailinformationen erneut die Funktionen getauscht.
			  Nun ist wieder SHIFT + PFEIL eine Zeile weiter und SHIFT + STRG + PFEIL einen Abschnitt weiter - wie vorher.
			  Dafür geht das Infofenster jetzt nach 30 Sekunden ohne Zeilen- oder Abschnittswechsel automatisch zu.
			- Beim TTS wurde Fehler mit verschiedenen Zeichen behoben (z. B. > und <). Daher sollten jetzt weniger Piepser für fehlende Wörter zu hören sein.
			- Fehler beim Durchschreiten von Instanz-Portalen (z. B. Eingang Tiefenbahn) wurden behoben.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
Änderungen in Version 20.4

	SkuNav
		Neuerungen
			- Im Menü unter "SkuNav > Daten" gibt es eine neue Option "Export aktueller Kontinent".
			- Im Ordner "Sku > SkuNav > routedata" gibt es jetzt Routen-Einzeldateien für die drei Kontinente: Kalimdor, Östliche Königreiche, Scherbenwelt.
			  Eine Gesamtdatei mit allen Routen gibt es nicht mehr (diese wurde mit der steigenden Routenzahl zu groß).

	SkuQuest
		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- Die NPC-, Objekt-, Item- und Questdatenbanken wurden mit einer vierstelligen Anzahl von Updates/Fixes aus Questie aktualisiert. 

	SkuOptions
		Neuerungen
			- SHIFT und STRG haben bei der Anzeige von Detailinformationen die Funktionen getauscht.
			  Ab sofort ist eine Zeile vor oder zurück blättern STRG + PFEIL RUNTER/HOCH (statt wie bisher SHIFT + PFEIL).
			  Einen ganzen Abschnitt vor oder zurück blättern bleibt wie bisher STRG + SHIFT + PFEIL RUNTER/HOCH.
			- Die aktuellen Routendateien (Stand 20.11.2021) wurde in "Sku > SkuNav > routedata" hinzugefügt.

	SkuCore
		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- Beim Würfeln sagt das Addon jetzt zur besseren Wahrnehmbarkeit "gewürfelt gier/bedarf/gepasst" statt nur "gier/bedarf/gepasst".

		Neuerungen

Änderungen in Version 20.3

	SkuCore
		Neuerungen
			- Neues Feature: Übersichtsseite
			  Mit SHIFT + PFEIL RUNTER kannst du eine Übersichtsseite aufrufen, auf der die folgenden Informationen angezeigt werden:
			  	- Gruppenmitglieder (nur in Gruppen)
				- Reparaturstatus
				- Gold
				- Freie Taschenplätze
			  Du kannst, wie bei allen anderen Ausgaben, mit PFEIL + HOCH/RUNTER zur nächsten/vorherigen Zeile blättern und mit SHIFT + PFEIL HOCH/RUNTER zum nächsten/vorherigen Abschnitt.

	SkuNav
		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- Die Ansage der globale Himmelsrichtung mit STRG + ALT wurde wieder entfernt.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
Änderungen in Version 20.2

	SkuChat
		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- Der Chat-Verlauf hat jetzt 100 Zeilen.

	SkuOptions
		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- Die rechte Shift-Taste beendet jetzt auch die Sprachausgabe vom Ingame-TTS (Wegpunkthinweise).

	SkuNav
		Neuerungen
			- Zur besseren Beacon-Ortung gibt es jetzt ein "Klick"-Geräusch, wenn du dich in die Richtung eines Beacons drehst. Achtung: Dazu benötigst du SkuBeaconSoundsets 19.7!
			  Sobald du +/- 5 Grad in die Richtung des Beacons schaust, mach es "Klick". Wenn du den 5-Grad-Bereich wieder verlässt, macht es "Klack".
			  Dazu gibt es unter "SkuNav > Optionen" drei neue Einstellungsmöglichkeiten:
			  - "Klick bei Beacons": Damit kannst du das "Klick"-Feature ein-/ausschalten (Standard: Ein)
			  - "Winkel für Klick bei Beacons": Damit kannst du den Grad-Bereich verändern, in dem der Klick auftritt (Standard: 5). Der Gradbereich gilt nur in Fünferschritten. 8, 9 oder 10 macht also keinen Unterschied. 5, 10 und 15 schon.
			  - "Ton für Klick bei Beacons": Damit kannst du zwischen zwei Sound-Sets wählen. "Klick" ist ein "Klick"/"Klack"-Geräusch. "Beep" ist das gleiche mit einem Piep-Geräusch (Standard: Klick).

		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- Die globale Himmelsrichtung kann jetzt auch mit STRG + ALT statt nur über ALTGr angesagt werden.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
Änderungen in Version 20.1

	SkuOptions
		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- Das ö kann jetzt genau wie alle anderen Umlaute zum Filtern im Menü verwendet werden.

	SkuCore
		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- BILD-HOCH scrollt jetzt nicht nur in Berufefenstern, sondern aktualisiert auch das Menü entsprechend.
			- Scrollen mit BILD-HOCH/RUNTER sollte jetzt in allen Handwerksfenstern funktionieren.
			- Das Lokal-Menü geht jetzt nicht mehr auf solange Bewegungstasten gedrückt sind. Geist freilassen und danach ungewollt automatisch laufen sollte daher nicht mehr vorkommen.
			- Diverse Änderungen am Post-Menü:
				- Das Post-Menü ist jetzt filterbar.
				- Das Senden von Gegenständen per Post sollte jetzt funktionieren.
				- Das Gegenstände-Menü bei einem neuen Brief ist jetzt filterbar.
				- Fehlender Empfänger und/oder Betreff werden jetzt beim Senden angesagt.
			- Der Zugriff auf die Gildenbank funktioniert jetzt wieder.

	SkuNav
		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- Karten-Bug für die eigenartige Zone zwischen Ödland und sengende Schlucht behoben.
			- Karten-Bug im Steinwerkpass behoben. Gebiet wurde Loch Modan zugeschlagen.
			- STRG + rechte Maustaste (Wegpunkt löschen) und STRG + Maustaste 5 (neuer Zonenpunkt) haben ihre Funktion getauscht.
			- Routen mit identischem Start- und Endpunkt und ohne weitere Zwischenwegpunkte werden jetzt ohne weitere Info automatisch gelöscht.
			- Bei eingeblendeter Sku-Minimap werden jetzt bei nicht sichtbaren Wegpunkten keine Tooltips mehr angezeigt.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
Änderungen in Version 20

	+++ ACHTUNG: Wenn du deine Einstellungen behalten möchtest, lies zwingend unten die Infos dazu! +++

	Die Organisationsstruktur der Sku-Addons wurde stark verändert
		Ab sofort gibt es nur noch ein Sku-Addon (also auch noch einen Odern), in dem sich alle Sku-Module befinden.
		Es muss nur noch dieses eine Sku-Addon aktualisiert werden.
		"SkuAudioData" und "SkuBeaconSoundsets" bleiben davon ausgeschlossen und getrennte Einzeladdons.
		Das hat mehrere Vorteile:
		- Die Addonliste und die Struktur werden übersichtlicher.
		- Beim Aktualisieren muss man nicht mehr mit vielen Ordnern hantieren.
		- Die Sku-Addons und die Audiodaten (SkuAudioData, SkuBeaconSoundsets) können problemlos getrennt voneinander aktualisiert werden.

	Einstellungen übernehmen
		Durch die Neuorganisation werden alle deine Einstellungen, Profile und Daten der Sku-Addons beim ersten Anmelden mit Version 20 gelöscht.
		Wenn du sie behalten möchtest, muss du VOR DEM ERSTEN START mit Version 20 eine Datei umbenennen:
		- Rufe folgenden Ordnern auf: <Dein-World-of-Warcraft-Ordner>\_classic_\WTF\Account\DEIN-ACCOUNTNAME\SavedVariables
		- Benenne in diesem Ordner die Datei SkuZOptions.lua in Sku.lua um.
		- Starte dann erst das Spiel.
		Wenn du das vor dem ersten Spielstart machst, bleiben alle Einstellungen erhalten. Wenn nicht, hast du ein komplett jungfräuliches Sku-Addon.

	Addon-Download
		Alle Addons (Sku, SkuAudiodata, SkuBeaconSoundsets, SkuFluegel) stehen ab sofort nicht mehr über Discord, sondern über eine zentrale Webseite zum Download bereit.
		Die URL der Downloadseite lautet: https://duugu.github.io/Sku/
		Die Seite ist extrem einfach gehalten und kann problemlos mit einem Screenreader gelesen werden.
		In Discord gibt es weiterhin den Channel "newsticker-sku-addon". Dort wird neben allgemeinen Infos zum Addon bei jeder neuen Version der Sku-Addons automatisch eine Meldung gepostet.
		Der Download findet jetzt jedoch über die zentrale neue Webseite statt.

	SkuCore
		Neuerungen
			- Das Berufefenster ist im Lokal-Menü verfügbar.
			- Im offenen Berufefenster kannst du jetzt mit BILD-HOCH und BILD-RUNTER in der Liste scrollen.
			- Das Ausbildungsfenster für Jägertiere ist im Lokal-Menü verfügbar.
			- Das Stall-Fenster für Jägertiere ist im Lokal-Menü verfügbar.

	SkuDB
		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- Einige Kartendaten wurden entfern. Daher funktionieren jetzt alle Zonen vor Instanzen korrekt (z. B. Gnomeregan, Uldaman etc.)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
Änderungen in Version 19.11

	SkuOptions:
		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- Das Filtern sollte jetzt auch für die Aktionsleisten korrekt funktionieren und den richtigen Untermenüpunkt hervorbringen.
			- Bei verringerter Beacon-Maximallautstärke geht das Beacon jetzt nicht mehr komplett aus wenn du weit weg bist.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
Änderungen in Version 19.10

	SkuOptions:
		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- Das Filtern sollte jetzt korrekt funktionieren und den richtigen Untermenüpunkt hervorbringen.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
Änderungen in Version 19.9

	SkuOptions:
		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- Wenn man aus einem gefilterten Menü in ein Untermenü geht, sollte der Filter nun korrekt gelöscht werden statt für immer bestehen zu bleiben.
		
	SkuQuest:
		Neuerungen
			- In den Menüs "Annahme", "Ziel" und "Abgabe" von Quests hat sich die Untermenüstruktur geändert.
			  Es gibt jetzt immer ein erstes Untermenü pro Mob-/NPC-Typ (z. B. "Hexer", "Ritter", "Fußsoldat", wenn du diese drei Mobtypen für eine Quest killen musst.)
			  Darunter gibt es jeweils drei Menüs: "Route", "Nahe Route" und "Wegpunkt". 
			  "Route" enthält natürlich alle Ziele mit Route. 
			  "Nahe Route" enthält nur die Ziel ohne direkte Route, aber mit einer Route, die mindestens bis auf 500 Meter an das Ziel heranführt.
			    Die Entfernung bei "Nahe Route" setzt sich aus der Entferung über die Route plus die Entferung vom Routenende zum eigentlichen Ziel zusammen.
			    Diese kombinierte Entferung wird gewichtet. Die Strecke vom Routenende zum eigentlichen Ziel zählt dreifach. 
			    Das sorgt dafür, dass die Routen bevorzugt werden, bei denen du die letzte Strecke zum Wegpunkt ohne Route möglichst nicht weit laufen musst.
			  "Wegpunkt" enthält die Wegpunkte für alle Ziele.
			  Darunter sind jeweils wieder Menüs: "Nach Name" und L["By distance"], mit einer entsprechenden Sortierung.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
Änderungen in Version 19.8

	SkuOptions:
		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- Ein Fehler mit den Untermenüs in "Neu" wurde behoben. Können jetzt wieder wie gewohnt zur Benennung verwendet werden.

		Neuerungen
			- Mit SHIFT + PFEIL RECHTS kannst du dir jetzt den aktuellen Menüpunkt buchstabieren lassen.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
Änderungen in Version 19.7

	SkuOptions:
		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- Ein interner Fehler beim Umbenennen von Wegpunkten wurde behoben.

		Neuerungen
			- Bei der Namenserstellung für Wegpunkte ("... > Neu") kann man jetzt direkt durch Eingabe die komplette Wortliste filtern und auswählen. 
			  Ohne erst in Untermenüs wie "Alle alphabetisch" gehen zu müssen. Die Untermenüs funktionieren aber natürlich auch weiter.
			  Dazu hängen direkt unter dem letzten Untermenü für die Worttypen ("Orientierung") Alle Wörter aus der gesamten Wortdatenbank im Neu-Hauptmenü.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
Änderungen in Version 19.6

	SkuOptions:
		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- Würfeln mit CTRL-SHIFT-X (Passen) geht jetzt wieder.

		Neuerungen
			- Das Würfelsystem wurde jetzt komplett auf die Tastenkombinationen umgestellt. Das Lokalmenü mit den Würfeloptionen gibt es nicht mehr. Auch nicht im Kampf in Instanzen.
			- Beim Würfeln kannst du dir jetzt mit CTRL-SHIFT-T den Tooltip für den Gegenstand anzeigen lassen, um den du gerade würfelst.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
Änderungen in Version 19.5

	SkuCore:
		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- Beim Belegen von Zugriffstasten für die Aktionsleisten werden jetzt die folgenden Tasten ignoriert: Pfeiltasten, w, a, s, d, alle Funktionstasten in Kombination mit SHIFT und CTRL-SHIFT.

	SkuOptions:
		Neuerungen
			- Vier neue Wörter wurden unter "Orte" eigenfügt: Azurmythosinsel, Blutmythosinsel, Immersangwald, Geisterlande
		
	SkuNav:
		Neuerungen
			- Die "Nahe Routen"-Funktion bei Quests zeigt jetzt nur noch Routen an, deren Ausstiegspunkt maximal 500 Meter vom Zielpunkt entfernt ist.
			- Es sind jetzt ALLE NPCs und Mobs des gesamten Spiels als Standard-Wegpunkte in der Datenbank enthalten. Nicht nur, wie bisher, die ersten drei pro Typ.
			  Es ist nun also möglich, zum Beispiel unter "SkuNav > Wegpunkt > Auswählen > Aktuelle Karte Entfernung" nach dem tatsächlich nächstgelegenen Mob eines Typs zu suchen.
			  Bitte gründlich testen und bei Fehlern/Problemen (z. B. Lag im Menü) direkt melden.
			- Die Liste "SkuNav > Wegpunkt > Auswählen > Alle alphabetisch" heißt jetzt nur noch "Alle" und ist nicht mehr alphabetisch sortiert.
			  Das hat Performance-Gründe. Außerdem ist es eh längst unmöglich in dieser Liste mit ca. 45.000 Wegpunkten manuell alphabetisch durchzublättern. :)
			- Über die Sku-Minimap können jetzt Zonen für "Aldor" und "Seher" definiert werden.
			  NUR FÜR ROUTENERSTELLER WICHTIG:
			    - Auf der Sku-Minimap und der normalen Minimap werden die neu zusätzlichen Standard-Wegpunkte (also alle über den ersten drei pro Typ) in türkis dargestellt.
			      Abgesehen davon unterscheidet sie nichts von den bisher schon verfügbaren ersten drei pro Typ (weiter in rosa). Sie können genauso wie alle anderen Punkte verwendet werden.
			      Durch die drastische Steigerung der anzuzeigenden Wegpunkte kann ein sehr weites Rauszoomen jedoch starkes Lag verursachen. 
			      In dem Fall einfach wieder etwas weiter reinzoomen. Dann wird es besser. Auf "Arbeitszoomreichweite" ist die Performance akzeptabel.
				 - Wegpunktkommentare werden jetzt in den Tooltips der Wegpunkte unter dem Namen in gelb angezeigt.
				 - Mit CTRL-SHIFT + mittlere Maustaste auf einen Wegpunkt löscht du alle Wegpunktkommentare dieses Wegpunktes.

		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- Es wurden fehlerhafte Zonen-IDs für die folgenden Zonen korrigiert: Der Lordameresee, Tarrens Mühle, Thoradinswall, Burg Durnholde, Dun Garok, Die Felder des Hügellands, Oststrand, Nethandersiedlung, Darrohügel, Südwacht, Thoradinswall, Weststrand, Das verbotene Meer, Gillijim's Isle, Island of Doctor Lapidis, Das große Meer, Der Südstrom, Das verhüllte Meer, Höhlen der Zeit, Onyxias Hort, Tore von Ahn'Qiraj, Das nördliche Meer, Twisting Nether


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
Änderungen in Version 19.4

	SkuCore:
		- Der Panikmodus wurde wieder gestrichen.

	SkuNav:
		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- Ein Fehler wurde behoben, bei dem sich die Sku-Minimap bei der Größenanderung über den ganzen Bildschirm ausgedehnt hat.
			- Man kann jetzt auch als Geist Routen und Wegpunkten folgen.
			- Wenn man sich als Geist wiederbelebt, wird der ausgewählte Schnellwegpunkt zur Leiche jetzt automatisch beendet.
			- Eine vergessene Debugausgabe wurde entfernt.
			- Das Starten einer Route über das aktuelle Ziel (CTRL + SHIFT + I) sollte jetzt korrekt funktionieren. 
			  (Natürlich nur, wenn es sich bei dem Ziel um einen Custom- oder Standardwegpunkt handelt. Ggf. vorher mit CTRL + SHIFT + U hinzufügen.)


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
Änderungen in Version 19.3

	SkuCore:
		Neuerungen
			- Es gibt jetzt eine Panik-Taste: STRG + SHIFT + X
			  Die Panik-Taste versetzt das Addon in den Panikmodus bzw. schaltet diesen wieder aus.
			  Der Panikmodus ist für Situationen gedacht, in denen schnell du den Weg zurücklaufen möchtest, den du gekommen bist. Zum Beispiel, weil du aus einem Kampf fliehen möchtest.
			  Sobald du den Panikmodus gestartet hast, führt dich das Addon über ein dynamisch großzügig positioniertes Beacon über genau den Weg zurück, den du gekommen bist (bis zu 500 Meter).
			  Du erreichst das Beacon nie. Es gibt keine "Wegpunkt erreicht"-Plings. Sobald du bis auf 20 Meter an das Beacon herankommst, wir es automatisch auf den nächsten Punkt deiner Rücklaufstrecke gesetzt.
			  Bei jeder Benutzung der Panik-Taste wird die aufgezeichnete Wegstrecke zurückgesetzt und beginnt ab deiner aktuellen Position.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
Änderungen in Version 19.2

	SkuQuest:
		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- Es wurden diverse Fehler bei der Anzeige der verfügbaren Quests und aller Quests in der Questdatenbank behoben, die zu falschen Anzeigen geführt haben.
			  (Zum Beispiel werden jetzt Quests angezeigt, die bei Objekten starten.)
			- Bei Quests werden jetzt unter Annahme, Ziel und abgabe noch Routen und Wegpunkte anzeigt die auf dem aktuellen Kontinent liegen.

	SkuOptions:
		Neuerungen
			- Ab sofort kann beim Filtern in Menüs das Leerzeichen verwendet werden
			- Interne Objekt-IDs werden nicht mehr vorgelesen. Nur noch die laufende Nummer.
			- Sven ist tot! (Will sagen, ich habe einen Fehler behoben, bei dem Quest als verfügbar angezeigt wurden, die nicht mehr verfügbar sind.)


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
Änderungen in Version 19.1

	SkuOptions:
		Neuerungen
			- Alle Menüs im Lokal-Menü sind jetzt filterbar (z. B. Flugmeister-Flugpunkteliste)

	SkuQuest:
		Neuerungen
			- Die Routen- und Wegpunktlisten unter "Questdatenbank > Annahme, Ziel und Abgabe" sind jetzt filterbar.
			- Bei "Nahe Routen" unter "Questdatenbank > Annahme, Ziel und Abgabe" wird jetzt der Wegpunktname vom Endziel statt der des Ausstiegspunktes der Route angezeigt.

		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- Ein Fehler bei als verfügbar angezeigten Quests mit bereits erledigten Voraussetzungen wurde behoben. (Beispiel: "Lieferung an Sven" von Elaine Treuwein, wenn man bereits bei Sven war.)

	SkuNav:
		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- Eine vergessene Debug-Meldung beim Erreichen von Wegpunkten wurde entfernt.
			- Die aktuellen Routendaten-Dateien wurden in SkuNav\routedata eingefügt.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
Änderungen in Version 19

	SkuCore:
		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- Die Questfortschritte werden jetzt lokal für jeden Char einzeln gespeichert.
			  Bei einem mit mehreren Chars verwendeten Profil sollte der Questfortschritt daher jetzt bei jedem Char korrekt gezählt werden.

		Neuerungen
			- Fliegen sollte jetzt angesagt werden.
			- Beim Zaubern außerhalb des Kampfes wird jetzt "Cast" gesagt. (Zeug aufsammeln IST Zaubern.)

	SkuOptions:
		Neuerungen
			- Es wurden viele weitere Wörter zur Audioliste hinzugefügt. Zum Beispiel Namen von Zaubern, für die Belegung der Aktionsleisten.

	SkuQuest:
		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- Ein Fehler bei Quests mit Pre-Quests in der Anzeige von verfügbaren Quests ("Questdatenbank > Nach Entfernung") wurde behoben. Es sollten jetzt alle verfügbaren Quests angezeigt werden.
			- Bei der Anzeige der verfügbaren Quest wird nun auch der benötigte Ruf überprüft.
			- Bei Quests werden jetzt für Routen/Wegpunkte Questannahme, -abgabe und -ziele nur noch Wegpunkte auf dem aktuellen Kontinent berücksichtigt.
		
		Neuerungen
			- Im Questlog gibt es jeweils unter "Annahme", "Ziel" "Abgabe" eine neue Option "Nahe Route". Diese wird angezeigt, wenn es keine direkte Route zum Ziel gibt. 
			  "Nahe Route" zeigt die Routenenden an, die am nahesten zum jeweiligen Ziel liegen. Sortiert nach der der Entfernung zwischen Routenendpunkt und jeweiligen Ziel.
			  Dabei wird, wie bei "Route folgen" gewohnt, immer der nächstgelegene Einstiegspunkt verwendet.
			  Die Einträge enthalten zuerst die Entferung vom Routenendpunkt zum tatsächlichen Ziel, dann die Strecke über die Route zu diesem Endpunkt und dann den Namen des Routenendziels.
			  Beispiel: "119 Meter ab Ende Route 1147 Meter Häscher der Blutenden Hand". 
			  Bedeutet: Der nächstgelegene vernetzte Routenpunkt zum Ziel ist "Häscher der Blutenden Hand". 
			    Er ist noch 119 Meter von deinem eigentlichen Ziel entfernt.
			    Die Route bis zum Routenziel "Häscher der Blutenden Hand" ist 1147 Meter lang.

	SkuNav:
		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- Die Liste der Wegpunkte unter "Wegpunkte > Alle NPCs > ..." hat jetzt Entferungsangaben und nach Entfernung sortiert.
			- Es wurde ein Fehler behoben, bei dem beim automatischen Löschen von defekten Routen die falschen Routen gelöscht wurden.
			- Es wurde ein Fehler behoben, der in Dun Morogh dafür gesorgt hat, dass alle Wegpunkte der Welt angezeigt wurden.
			- Beim Wegpunktbenennen sind jetzt unter "Alle alphabetisch" auch die Zonennamen als Wörter enthalten.
			- Ein Problem mit der Wegpunktanzeige im Tunnel im Norden von Loch Modan wurde behoben.
			- In der Tiefenbahn kann man jetzt das Wegpunktmenü öffnen und Wegpunkte auswählen.
			- Routen, die am selben Punkt beginnen und enden und keine weiteren Zwischenpunkte enthalten, werden jetzt beim Import ignoriert.

		Neuerungen
			- Die Liste der Standardwegpunkte enthält jetzt auch alle Objekte in der Spielwelt. 
			  Also, Dinge, die auf dem Boden liegen, die gesammelt werden müssen, die angeklickt werden müssen usw.
			  Zur Unterscheidung von eigenen und NPC-Wegpunkten ist Objekt-Standardwegpunkten das Wort "OBJEKT" vorangestellt.
			- Es gibt jetzt unter "SkuNav > Wegpunkt > Verwalten" drei Optionen zur Wegpunktbearbeitung (natürlich nur für selbst erstellte Wegpunkte):
			  - "Löschen"
			  - "Umbenennen" (funktioniert nach dem ganz normalen Prinzip der Namenszustammenstellung)
			  - "Kommentar zuweisen": Mit dieser Funktion kannst du einem einen Audiokommentar zuweisen.
				 Wenn du sie auswählst, geht ein Eingabefenster auf. In dieses muss du dann direkt den Text für den Audiokommentar eingeben und die Eingabe mit ENTER abschließen.
				 Der eingegebene Text wird ab dann bei jedem Erreichen des Wegpunktes mit der WoW-TTS Stimme vorgelesen.
				 Ein Wegpunkt kann beliebig viele Kommentare haben.
			- Es gibt jetzt markierte Zonen: Weltgrenze, Flugbereich, Fraktion (Allianz oder Horde).
			  Das Betreten und Verlassen dieser Zonen wird angesagt.
			- Metarouten werden jetzt beim Start und bei jeder Routen- bzw. Wegpunktänderung berechnet und zwischengespeichert.
			- Die SkuNav-Option für die Lautstärke der Beacons ist jetzt wieder aktiv.
			- Beim Routenerstellen werden Schnittpunkte mit anderen Routen bzw. nahe bestehende Routenpunkte jetzt nur noch auf Anforderung erstellt/übernommen, wenn man beim Routenpunkterstellen ALT festhält.
			  (Im Gegensatz zu vorher, bei dem dies bei gedrückter ALT-Taste _verhindert_ wurde.)


		NUR FÜR ROUTENERSTELLER
			- Es gibt jetzt eine neue grafische Routenanzeige: die Sku-Minimap. 
			  Die Sku-Minimap wird mit STRG + SHIFT + F geöffnet/geschlossen.
			  Die Anzeige auf der Minimap gibt es zwar noch, aber sie kann nicht mehr zum Routenerstellen per Klicken verwendet werden und wird auch nicht mehr weiter gepflegt.
			  Da das für Blinde nicht relevant ist, gibt es alle weiteren Informationen (Mac) dazu im persönlichen Gespräch.
			- Die Performance der grafischen Anzeige auf der Minimap wurde erneut deutlich optimiert.
			- Die grafische Anzeige auf der Minimap ist jetzt in allen Zoomstufen korrekt und die Abweichung bei weiter entfernten Punkten ist geringer.
			- Neue Farben für die Routenanzeige auf der Minimap:
				- Rot: Custom (selbst erstellte) Wegpunkte bzw. modifizierte Creature-/Objekt-Wegpunkte
				- Rosa: Standard Creature-Wegpunkte
				- Grün: Standard Objekt-Wegpunkte
			- Neue Maustastenaktionen für die Routenaktivitäten auf der Minimap:
				- STRG + MITTLERE MAUS auf Wegpunkt: Route starten oder beenden
				- STRG + RECHTE MAUS auf Custom-Wegpunkt: Wegpunkt löschen
				- STRG + LINKE MAUS auf Custom-Wegpunkt + halten und ziehen: Wegpunkt verschieben
				- STRG + SHIFT + LINKE MAUS auf Standard-Wegpunkt + halten und ziehen: Wegpunkt verschieben
				- STRG + MAUS4 bei Routenaufzeichnung: Wegpunkt an Mausposition setzen
				- STRG + SHIFT + MAUS4 bei Routenaufzeichnung: großen Wegpunkt an Mausposition setzen
			- Mit CTRL-SHIFT-I kannst du jetzt bei der Routenaufzeichnung die CTRL-MITTLERE-MAUSTASTE-Funktionalität für dein aktuelles Ziel nutzen. 
			  Statt des angeklickten Punktes wird sie für dein aktuelles Ziel ausgeführt.
			  Sollte dein aktuelles Ziel kein Standardwegpunkt sein, passiert nichts.
			  Wenn du weiter als 50 Meter von deinem Ziel entfernt bist, passiert ebenfalls nichts.
			  Achtung: Das Addon kann bei mehreren gleichnamigen Mobs/NPCs in der Nähe nicht feststellen welcher von denen dein aktuelles Ziel ist.
			  Wenn es mehrere Mobs/NPCs mit demselben Namen in der Nähe gibt, wird der genommen, der dir am nächsten ist.
			- Mit CTRL-SHIFT-U kannst du jetzt einen NPC/Mob, der noch kein Standardpunkt ist (d.h. es gibt für diesen keinen rosa/roten Punkt auf der MM, 
			   weil er nicht zu den 3 Standardpunkten bei Mobs/NPC mit mehreren Spawnpunkten gehört), zu den Standardpunkten hinzufügen.
			  Den aktuelles Ziel wird zur Liste der Standardpunkte hinzugefügt. Danach kannst du es ganz normal nutzen. Es gilt alles, was oben bei CTRL-SHIFT-I gilt.



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
Änderungen in Version 18.1

	SkuCore:
		Neuerungen
			- Die Aktionsleisten haben weitere Funktionen erhalten:
				- Hinter jedem Button wird jetzt die aktuelle Tastaturbelegung für diesen ansagt.
				- Unter jedem Button gibt es jetzt einen Menüpunkt "Tastenbelegung". Wenn du diesen mit ENTER auswählst, kommst du direkt in den Tastaturbelegungsmodus für diesen Button.
				  Die nächste Taste oder Tastaturkombination, die du dann drückst, wird direkt für den Button verwendet. Es gibt keine weitere Abfrage oder Warnung.
				  Sollte die gewählte Tastaturkombination schon für etwas anderes verwendet werden, so wird diese andere Verwendung ohne Nachfrage gelöscht.
				  Du kannst alternativ den Tastaturbelegungsmodus mit ESCAPE verlassen und den Belegungsvorgang so abbrechen.
				- Unter jedem Button gibt es jetzt die Menüpunkte "Gegenstände" und "Makros", mit denen du Gegenstände und Makros auf Buttons legen kannst.
				- Die Listen mit den Zaubern, Gegenständen und Makros sind nun filterbar.

	SkuNav
		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- In der Routendatei für die Zangarmarschen wurde ein paar fehlene Routen hinzugefügt.
			- Die Performance der Routenanzeige auf der Minimap wurde erneut dramatisch verbessert und ist jetzt auch bei sehr, sehr vielen Routen noch brauchbar.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
Änderungen in Version 18

	SkuCore:
		Neuerungen
			- Die Aktionsleisten können jetzt in einer ersten Basisversion genutzt werden.
			  Unter "SkuCore > Aktionsleisten" findest du alle im Spiel verfügbaren Aktionsleisten.
			  Darunter jeweils alle Buttons auf der entsprechenden Leiste (12 pro Leiste) und die aktuelle Aktion des Buttons.
			  Unter den Buttons findest du alle Zauber aus deinem Zauberbuch. 
			  Zuerst ist dort eine Menüebene mit den drei Kategorien deines Zauberbuchs. Darunter dann alle Zauber aus der jeweiligen Kategorie. Passive Zauber werden nicht in der Liste aufgeführt, da sie nicht platziert werden können.
			  Wählst du dort einen der Zauber aus, wird diese auf den entsprechenden Button der entsprechenden Aktionsleiste platziert.
			  Viele weitere Dinge im Aktionsleisten Menü fehlen noch und kommen später. Zum Beispiel:
			  - Gegenstände und Makros auf Leisten legen
			  - Begleiterleisten
			  - Tastenbelegung anzeigen/ändern
			  - Blättern in der Haupt Aktionsleiste
			  - etc.
			  Das Ganze funktioniert nur mir den originalen AKtionsleisten von Blizzard. Wenn irgendwelche Actionbar-Addons installiert sind, schlägt es mit größter Wahrscheinlichkeit fehl. Das gilt auch für ElvUI.

	SkuMob:
		Neuerungen
			- Unter "SkuMob > Optionen" gibt es eine neue Option namens "Bei markierten Zielen nur Markierung ansagen".
			  Mit dieser Option wird bei Zielen, die eine der acht Zielmarkierungen (Totenkopf, X, Mond etc.) haben nur noch die Markierung angesagt. Nicht mehr Name, Level etc.

	SkuNav
		Neuerungen
			- Es gibt unter "SkuNav > Optionen" eine neue Option namens "Zwischenwegpunkt auf 3 Meter erreichen".
			  Diese ist standardmäßig EINGESCHALTET.
			  Bisher musstest du beim Folgen einer Route kleine Zwischenwegpunkte immer bis auf 1 Meter genau erreichen. Das war häufig mühsam, und in 90 % aller Fälle unnötig. Diese Wegpunkte auf 3 Meter zu erreichen genügt auch.
			  Durch die neue Option brauchst du jetzt beim Routen folgen nur noch auf 3 Meter an die kleinen Zwischenwegpunkte rankommen, damit sie als erreicht gelten.
			  In manchen Situationen reicht das jedoch nicht. Dann muss es auf 1 Meter genau sein. Zum Beispiel bei einer engen Tür.
			  Dann kannst du mit STRG + SHIFT + Q auf die Genauigkeit von 1 Meter umschalten. Mit erneutem STRG + SHIFT + Q wechselst du wieder zu 3 Meter.
			  Wenn du also merkst, dass du mit 3 Meter Genauigkeit bei einem Wegpunkt nicht weiter kommst (feststeckst), schaltest du auf 1 Meter um, gehst zum vorherigen Routenpunkt zurück (mit STRG + SHIFT + S), und versuchst es erneut.
			- Beim Folgen von Routen über "Ziele Entferung" wird jetzt aus Geschwindigkeitsgründen nur noch der dir am nächsten gelegene Einstiegspunkt angezeigt, statt wie bisher bis zu 10 nahe Einstiegspunkte.
			  Dafür beträgt die Reichweite, in der nach möglichen Einstiegspunkten gesucht wird, nun 1000 Meter, statt wie bisher nur 30 Meter.
			  Sollte dieser eine Einstiegspunkt nicht passend sein (z. B., weil er hinter einer Wand liegt), musst du dich ein paar Meter bewegen oder über einen Wegpunkt zu einem anderen Ort wechseln, an dem ein passender Einstiegspunkt der dir am nächsten gelegene ist.
			- Beim Erreichen eines Routenziels wird jetzt wie gewünscht nicht mehr das erreichte Ziel angesagt, sondern nur noch "Ziel erreicht".
			- Der Wortliste für die Wegpunktbenennung wurden neue Worte hinzugefügt:
			  "Aldor", "Seher" (unter "Klassen")
			  Alle Kartennamen der Scherbenwelt (unter "Orte")
			  "drinnen" und "draußen" (unter "Orientierung")
			  Die sechs Hauptstädte aus der alten Welt (unter L["Zones"])
			- Unter "SkuNav > Wegpunkt > Auswählen" gibt es jetzt ganz unten in der Liste eine neue Auswahl namens "Aktuelle Karte Entfernung mit Auto".
			  In dieser Liste werden alle Wegpunkte der aktuellen Karte INKLUSIVE aller Autopunkte, sortiert nach ihrer Entferung, angezeigt.
			  Die Liste sollte normalerweise nicht gebraucht werden. Nur, falls du über den nächstgelegenen Routenpunkt in eine Route einsteigen möchtest, und der einzige angezeigte Routenpunkt nicht brauchbar ist (z. B., weil er hinter einer Wand ist). In diesem Fall kannst du diese neue Auswahl nutzen, um nach anderen Punkten (inkl. Autopunkte) Autopunkten in der Nähe zu suchen, diese anzulaufen, und von dort den Routeneinstieg zu machen.
			- Die Routendatei "alle" (im Ordner "SkuNav > routedata") wurde aktualisiert und enthält nun wieder alle bisher aufgezeichneten Routen.

		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- Diverse Menüs wie "Alle Wegpunkte alphabetisch" sind dank Optimierungen deutlich schneller geworden.
			- Die Routenanzeige auf der Minimap (STRG + SHIFT + R) versursacht weniger Lag.
			- In den Routendaten für Shattrath war die Route zu Vekax defekt und ist jetzt korrigiert.
			- In den Routendaten für Sturmwind gibt es jetzt einen Wegpunkt "Magiersanktum Portal draußen" der außerhalb direkt vorm Portal in den Magierraum liegt und einen "Magiersanktum Portal drinnen", der innerhalb direkt vor dem Portal liegt.
			  Die beiden Wegpunkte sind nicht durch eine Route verbunden, da man beim Durchschreiten des Portals in den Magierraum teleportiert wird, und das die Route kaputt machen würde.
			  Wenn du IN den Raum willst, musst du der Route zu "Magiersanktum Portal draußen" folgen, dann manuell ein paar Schritte vor durch das Portal gehen, und dann drinnen einen Wegpunkt zu einem der NPCs im Raum auswählen.
			  Wenn du AUS dem Raum willst, musst du zum Wegpunkt "Magiersanktum Portal drinnen" gehen, dann manuell ein paar Schritte vor durch das Portal gehen, und dann draußen von "Magiersanktum Portal draußen" ein Routenfolgen zu deinem eigentlichen Zielpunkt starten.

	SkuQuest
		Neuerungen
			- Beim Folgen von Routen über "Questdatenbank > Start in Zone > Nach Entferung > ..." wird jetzt aus Geschwindigkeitsgründen nur noch der dir am nächsten gelegene Einstiegspunkt angezeigt, statt wie bisher bis zu 10 nahe Einstiegspunkte.
			  Dafür beträgt die Reichweite, in der nach möglichen Einstiegspunkten gesucht wird, nun 1000 Meter, statt wie bisher nur 30 Meter.
			  Sollte dieser eine Einstiegspunkt nicht passend sein (z. B., weil er hinter einer Wand liegt), musst du dich ein paar Meter bewegen oder über einen Wegpunkt zu einem anderen Ort wechseln, an dem ein passender Einstiegspunkt der dir am nächsten gelegene ist.

		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- In der Questdatenbank wurde zu Quests unter "Rassen" nur "Horde" ODER "Allianz" angezeigt. Jedoch nicht beides, wenn eine Quest für beide verfügbar ist. Dieser Fehler ist behoben.
			- In der Questdatenbank werden jetzt keine Quests mehr als verfügbar angezeigt, die Vorquests zu aktuellen Quests in deinem Questlog sind. (@Kai: Testen mit "Sprecht mit Rilak dem Erlösten". Sollte jetzt nicht mehr angeboten werden.)
			- Ein paar geringfügige Optimierung in der Questdatenbank. Unter Annehme/Ziel/Abgabe gibt es bei vielen Routen (z. B. in Shattrath) immer noch ein kurzes Lag. Es sollte aber zumindest etwas besser sein.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
Änderungen in Version 17.2

	SkuNav:
		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- Die Zonenlisten (z. B. "SkuNav > Wegpunkt > Neu > Zonen") sind jetzt wieder verfügbar.

	SkuCore:
		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- Bankfach 1 sollte jetzt nicht mehr komplett leer angezeigt werden.
			- Post-Briefe sollten jetzt gelöscht werden können.
			- Bereits an einen neuen Brief angehängte Gegenstände werden nun nicht mehr in der Liste angezeigt, um ein doppeltes Anhängen an einen Brief zu verhindern.
			- Es gibt jetzt eine Option "Alle öffnen", mit der alle Briefe im Postkasten geöffnet werden können. Danach kommen dann die einzelnen Briefe als weitere Menüpunkte.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
Änderungen in Version 17.1

	SkuNav:
		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- Einen Fehler behoben, der beim aktiven Wegpunkt/Routen folgen und Ruhestein auftrat.

	SkuCore:
		Neuerungen
			- Die Post ist jetzt bedienbar.
			  Du musst selbst auf den Briefkasten klicken. WoW lässt das Öffnen des Briefkastens über Addons nicht zu.
			  Falls du nicht weißt wie das geht, frage die Anderen nach einem Skript zur mittigen Positionierung deiner Maus.
			  Sobald du am Briefkasten mit Rechtsklick die Post öffnest, geht das Audiomenü mit "SkuCore > Post" auf.
			  Dort findest du als ersten Menüpunkt "Neuer Brief", über dessen Untermenüpunkte du einen neuen Brief schreiben kannst.
			  Direkt darunter auf derselben Menüebene findest du danach alle Briefe aus deinem Postkasten. Format: Nummer, Absender, Betreff.
			  Du kannst dir die einzelnen Briefe wie alle Text im Menü mit SHIFT + PFEIL HOCH/RUNTER vorlesen lassen.
			  Unter jedem Brief gibt es weitere Untermenüpunkte:
			  - Antworten: funktioniert genauso wie "Neuer Brief")
			  - Anhänge: Gibt es nur, wenn im Brief Gegenstände oder Gold sind. Unter "Anhänge" findest du "Gold nehmen" (falls Gold drin ist) und/oder "Alle nehmen" und eine Liste mit den Gegenständen im Brief (falls Gegenstände drin sind). Bei jedem Gegenstand kannst du dir mit SHIFT + PFEIL HOCH/RUNTER den Tooltip anzeigen lassen.
			  - Löschen: Löscht den Brief
			  Briefe schreiben kannst du entweder über "Neuer Brief" oder über "Antworten" bei einem Brief aus deinem Postkasten. Beides funktioniert identisch.
			  Es gibt jeweils mehrere Unterpunkte:
			  - Empfänger
			  - Betreff
			  - Text
			  - Gold
			  - Gegenstände
			  - Senden
			  Wenn du "Empfänger", "Betreff" oder "Text" auswählst, öffnet sich ein Eingabefeld, in das du den entsprechenden Text eingeben und die Eingabe mit ENTER abschließen musst.
			  Du musst für einen neuen Brief mindestens einen Empfänger und einen Betreff eingeben.
			  Unter "Gold" gibt es ein Untermenü mit dem du bestimmte Goldbeträge an den Brief anhängen kannst.
			  Unter "Gegenstände" werden alle Gegenstände aus deinen Taschen aufgeführt. Wenn du einen der Gegenstände auswählst, wird er an den neuen Brief angehängt. Natürlich kannst du dir auch hier mit SHIFT + PFEIL HOCH/RUNTER das Tooltip vorlesen lassen.
			  Mit "Senden" schickst du den Brief ab, sobald du ihn fertig erstellt hast.
			  Direkt nach dem Senden gibt es eine Audiorückmeldung, ob das Senden geklappt hat.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
Änderungen in Version 17

	SkuDB:
		- Aufgrund der inzwischen enormen Datenmengen wurden alle Datenbanktabellen in ein neues verpflichtendes Sku-Addon namens SkuDB ausgelagert.
		  Dieses bietet keinerlei Funktionalitäten für Benutzer. Es ist für die internen Daten zuständig.

	SkuChat:
		Neuerungen
			- Der Chat wird jetzt direkt im Spiel vorgelesen. Dazu verwendet das Addon die neue und noch nicht offiziell verfügbare Ingame-TTS-Engine von Blizzard.
			  Du öffnest den Chat weiterhin normal mit SHIFT + F2. Die erste Zeile (die letzte Chatnachricht) wird direkt vorgelesen. 
			  Du kannst mit PFEIL HOCH/RUNTER die restlichen Zeilen durchgehen.
			  Springst du zu einer anderen Zeilen wenn die aktuelle noch nicht komplett vorgelesen ist, bricht die aktuelle einfach ab und die nächste Zeile beginnt.
			  Für die Chatausgabe gibt es unter "SkuChat > Optionen" drei neue Einstellungen:
				TTS Stimme: Listet alle Stimmen auf, die auf deinem Computer (NICHT in WoW) installiert und somit verfügbar sind. Verwendet standardmäßig die erste Stimme in der Liste. Welche das auch immer bei dir sein mag. :)
				TTS Geschwindigkeit: Sprechgeschwindigkeit
				TTS Lautstärke: Die Lautstärke NUR für diese Chat-Vorlesefunktion.

	SkuQuest:
		- Das nervige Quest-Pling beim Einloggen ist jetzt (mal wieder) weg. Bis zum nächsten Mal. :)

	SkuNav:
		- Die Standardbelegung der Schnellwahltasten wurde geändert:
			SHIFT F9: SkuNav,Wegpunkt,Auswählen,Aktuelle Karte Entfernung
			SHIFT F10: SkuNav,Route,Route folgen,Ziele Entfernung
			SHIFT F11: SkuNav,Alles abwählen

	SkuOptions:
		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- Teilweise wurden Wörter der Audioausgabe abgeschnitten oder waren zu lang.
			  "Questdatenbank" wurde z. B. nur als "Questda" vorgelesen. Beim Wort "und" war immer eine zu lange Pause dahinter.
			  Dieses Problem sollte jetzt beseitigt sein.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
Änderungen in Version 16.2

	SkuNav:
		Neuerungen
			- Mit STRG + SHIFT + R werden jetzt nicht nur die Routen und deren Wegpunkte auf der Minimap angezeigt, sondern alle Wegpunkte aus der Datenbank.
			  Das ist zurzeit sehr, sehr laggy und nicht zum Spielen gedacht! Es dient nur zur internen Entwicklung.

	SkuOptions:
		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- Leere Taschenplätze werden jetzt wieder korrekt angezeigt.
			- Handeln sollte jetzt auch mehrmals hintereinander ohne Fehler funktionieren.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
Änderungen in Version 16.1

	SkuNav:
		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- Mehrere Probleme mit falschen Karten-IDs bei Routen wurde behoben. (Unterzonen Level 3, identische Unterzonennamen in unterschiedlichen Zonen)

	SkuQuest:
		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- Einen Fehler behoben, bei dem mit einem leeren Questlog in der Questdatenbank keine verfügbaren Quest für die Zone angezeigt wurden.
			- Vor Quests im Questlog werden jetzt wenn zutreffend diverse Statuswerte angesagt:
			  - Fehlgeschlagen
			  - Fertig
			  - Gruppe/Schlachtzug
			  - Daily
			  - PvP


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
Änderungen in Version 16

	SkuQuest:
		Neuerungen
			- SkuQuest ist jetzt Teil des Menüs. 
			  Das Questlog ist weiterhin mit L zu öffnen. Aber es wird dabei das Audiomenü mit dem Pfad "SkuQuest > Aktuelle Quests" geöffnet.
			  SkuQuest hat zwei neue Untermenüs bekommen:
			  - Aktuelle Quests: Enthält alle Quests in deinem Questlog. Erster Untermenüpunkt "Alle" enthält alle Quests aus dem Log. Darunter sind weitere Untermenüs in denen die Quests aus dem Log nach Zonen sortiert sind.
			  - Questdatenbank: Das ist eine komplette durchsuchbare Datenbank aller Quests im Spiel (von Questie geklaut).
			  In den Untermenüs kann du wie bekannt bei jeder Quest "SHIFT + PFEIL RUNTER/HOCH" drücken, um die die Questdetails für die aktuell angezeigt vorlesen zu lassen.
			  Du kannst wie bisher mit "STRG + SHIFT * PFEIL RUNTER/HOCH" zwischen den Abschnitten blättern. Die Questdetails für die Quests aus dem Questlog sehen wie bisher aus.
			  Die Questdetails für die Quests in der Questdatenbank umfassen etwas andere Informationen:
				- Quest ID
				- Name
				- Status: offen/abgelossen/im Log
				- Zone
				- Level: Questlevel und in Klammer das Mindestlevel
				- Ziele: der Kurztext zum Questziel
				- Rassen: Horde, Allianz oder ggf. Einzelrassen, falls es Beschränkungen gibt
				- Klassen: falls es Beschränkungen auf Klassen gibt
				- Pre Quest: Die Namen aller erforderlichen Pre Quests
				- Quests Gruppe: Diese Quests musst du zusätzlich zur angezeigten Quest abschließen, um die Folgequest freizuschalten
				- Eigenschaften: Teilbar, Episch, Raid, Täglich			  
			  
			  Die Questdatenbank hat zwei Untermenüs:
			  - Start in Zone: 
			    Dieses Untermenü enthält eine gefilterte Liste aller Quest, die du annehmen kannst. Mit der Entferung zum Questgeber, sortiert nach Entfernung.
			    Dazu werden die folgenden Bedingungen berücksichtigt: 
				 - aktuelle Zone
				 - Fraktion
				 - Klasse
				 - Level
				 - Vorgequests erledigt
				 - noch nicht abgeschlossen und nicht im Questlog
			  - Alle: 
			    Dieses Untermenü enthälte eine unsortiert Liste ALLER Quests im Spiel (zu Recherchezwecken)
			  
			  Unter jeder Quest in der Questdatenbank findest du jeweils mehrere Untermenüs:
			  - Pre Quests: Wenn die Quest pre Quests hat, werden die in diesem Menü aufgeführt. Wenn du eine der Pre Quests in diesem Menü auswählst, springt das Menü zu dieser Quest.
			  - Annahme: Enthält die Namen der NPCs, bei der du die Quest annehmen kannst (Normalerweise nur einer). 
			    Unter jedem Namen sind weitere Untermenüs: "Route" und "Wegpunkt". 
				 "Route" ist nur vorhanden, wenn es eine Route zu diesem NPC gibt. Wegpunkt ist immer vorhanden.
				 In "Route" und "Wegpunkt" kann du direkt das Folgen einre Route bzw. eines Wegpunkts zu diesen NPC (dem Questgeber) starten. Die Auswahl hat weitere Untermenüs, die genauso wie das normale Folgen einer Route/eines Wegpunkts funktionieren.
			  - Abgabe: Genau wie "Annahme". Nur für den NPC, bei dem die fertige Quest abgegeben wird (meist mit "Annahme" identisch).
			  - Ziele: Eine Liste der Questziele, die du ebenfalls wieder in den jeweiligen Untermenüs als Route (falls vorhanden) oder Wegpunkt auswählen kannst.
			    Wenn keine Ziele da sind, fehlt dieser Punkt.
			    Im Moment werden Ziele nur für Quest angezeigt, bei denen man Mobs killen oder mit NPCs interagieren muss.
				 Weitere Ziele werden folgen. Beispielsweise Objekte, mit denen man interagieren muss

	SkuNav:
		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- Das Weiterschalten zwischen Routenwegpunkten, die Auswahl von Schnellwegpunkten und das Festlegen von Schnellwegpunkten ist jetzt auch im Kampf möglich.	
			- Mit Version 14.4 wurde eine Funktion eingebaut, mit der man die Beacon-Lautstärke anpassen kann ("SkuNav > Optionen > Beacon Lautstärke". 
			  Ich habe das Gefühl, dass diese die 3D-Ortung verschlechtert hat. Daher habe ich sie jetzt erstmal deaktivert. 
			  Sind die Beacon-Positionen jetzt wieder besser erkennbar?


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
Änderungen in Version 15.5

	SkuNav:
		Neuerungen
			- Beim Folgen von Routen wird jetzt bei jedem erreichten Wegpunkt die Anzahl der verbleibenden Punkte bis zum Ziel angesagt.
			- Beim Folgen von Routen kann jetzt zum vorherigen/nächsten Wegpunkt gewechselt werden.
				STRG + SHIFT + W: nächster Wegpunkt
				STRG + SHIFT + S: vorheriger Wegpunkt

	SkuMob:
		Neuerungen
			- Wenn ein neuer Gegner ins Ziel genommen wird, gibt es jetzt bei allen Gegnern die bereits mit dir oder einem Gruppenmitglied im Kampf sind einen kurzen Piepser.
			- Wenn Gegnern ein Zielsymbol zugewiesen ist, wird dieses jetzt vor dem Gegnernamen angesagt. Es gibt die folgenden Symbole:
				- Kopf (kurz für "Totenkopf", meist das Primärziel)
				- Kreuz (ein rotes X, meist das zweite Ziel)
				- Mond (ein weißer Mond, häufig ein CC-Ziel, z. B. Schaf)
				- Quadrat (ein blaues Quadrat, häufig ein CC-Ziel, z. B. Eisfalle)
				- Stern (ein gelber Stern)
				- Kreis (ein orangener Kreis)
				- Diamant (ein lila Diamant)
				- Dreieck (ein grünes Dreieck)


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
Änderungen in Version 15.4

	SkuNav:
		Neuerungen
			- Wenn bei der Auswahl eines Wegpunktes bzw. einer Route bereits einem Wegpunkt oder einer Route gefolgt wurde, gab es bisher nur eine Fehlermeldung.
			  Ab sofort wird dabei automatisch der alte Wegpunkt bzw. die alte Route abgewählt und der neue Wegpunkt bzw. die neue Route wird ausgewählt. 
			  Es ist nicht mehr nötig vorher explizit das laufende Folgen zu beenden.
			- Es gibt jetzt "kleine" und "große" Wegpunkte. Die Größe eines Punktes bestimmt wie nahe man an ihn herankommen muss, damit er als erreicht gilt.
			  An "Kleine" Punkte muss man bis auf 2 Meter herankommen. An die neuen "großen" Punkte muss man nur auf 8 Meter herankommen.
			  Die großen Punkte haben zur Unterscheidung ein anderes Audio-Beacon.
			  Die Größe eines Punktes wird bei seiner Erstellung festgelegt.
			  Bei der Routenerstellung gibt es dazu jetzt zwei Tastenkombinationen für Zwischen-Wegpunkte:
			    Kleiner Punkt: STRG + SHIFT P
			    Großer Punkt: STRG + SHIFT * O
			  Bei der Erstellung neuer Wegpunkte und Routen-Endpunkte kann man die Größe unter "Neu" mit dem Menüpunkt "Größe" festlegen (Standard: klein).

		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- Ein Problem mit Routen/Wegpunkten am dunklen Portal wurde behoben, das dafür gesorgt hat, dass der Import/Export von Routen pro Zone einen Fehler verursacht hat.
			- Beim Import und Export von Routendaten tritt jetzt kein spürbares Lag mehr auf.
			  Der Import geschieht jetzt direkt nachdem die Importdaten mit STRG + V eingefügt wurden. ENTER zu drücken ist nicht mehr nötigt. Das Addon sagt das auch so.
		
	SkuOptions:
		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- Ein Prozentzeichen (%) im Text wird jetzt vorgelesen und bleibt nicht einfach stumm.
			- Die TTS-Engine (Sprachausgabe) wurde teilweise neu implementiert, um das manchmal auftretende Problem mit durcheinandergewürfelten Wörtern zu beheben.
			  In diesem Zusammenhang musste die Funktionsweise der Einstellung für die Geschwindigkeit der Ausgabe (Audio Dauer Pause) überarbeitet werden.
			  Daher wurde die Einstellung mit dieser Version auf ihren Standardwert zurückgesetzt (85 Prozent).
			  Falls du diese Einstellung verändert hattest, musst du deine Änderung erneut durchführen. (SkuOptions > Optionen > Audio Dauer Pause)


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
Änderungen in Version 15.3

	SkuOptions:
		Neuerungen
			- Das Würfeln auf Dinge kann jetzt per Tastendruck erfolgen. Dazu stehen folgende Tastenkombinationen zur Verfügung:
			    Bedarf: STRG + SHIFT + B
			    Gier: STRG + SHIFT + G
			    Passen: STRG + SHIFT + X
			    Aktuellen Würfel-Gegenstand erneut ansagen: STRG + SHIFT + C
			- Wenn das Würfelfenster im Kampf aufgeht, wird nicht das Audiomenü geöffnet. (Das ist im Kampf nicht möglich.)
			  Stattdessen sagt das Addon jetzt an, dass auf einen Gegenstand gewürfelt werden muss. Es sagt folgendes an, sobald ein Würfelfenster aufgeht:
			    Gegenstandsname, Qualität ("Selten", "Episch" etc.), Bind-Typ (BOE, BOP), Gegenstandtyp (z. B. "Waffe"), Untertyp (z. B. "Einhandaxt")
			  Dann drückst du eine der Tastenkombinationen (STRG + SHIFT + B/G/X) zum Würfeln.
			  Sollten das Würfelfenster mehrere Gegenstände enthalten, sagt dir das Addon nach dem Würfeln auf den ersten direkt den nächsten an. Dann würfelst du mit der Tastenkombi auf diesen. Und so weiter.
			  ACHTUNG: Wenn du auf einen BOP-Gegenstand würfelst, bestätigt das Addon für dich ohne Rückfrage die Warnung dazu, dass der Gegenstand an dich gebunden ist, wenn du ihn lootest. Es gibt also keine Extra-Warnung dazu mehr!
			- Bei einem Würfelfenster außerhalb des Kampfes geht weiterhin ganz normal das Audiomenü mit dem Lokal-Menü auf. Dort kannst du weiterhin würfeln und dir auch das Items detailliert anzeigen lassen.
			  Zusätzlich kannst du auch mit dem offenen Audiomenü die neuen Tastenkombinationen für das Würfeln nutzen.

		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- Diverse vergessene Chat-Ausgaben mit Debugmeldungen wurden entfernt. :)

	SkuNav:
		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- Es wurde, mal wieder, ein Fehler mit dem Datenimport behoben.

	SkuCore:
		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- Es wurde ein Fehler behoben, bei dem SkuFluegel-Nutzern der Status manchmal erst nach 5 Sekunden angezeigt wurde.
			- Wie gewünscht, wird ab sofort auch dann wieder "Folgen" gesagt, wenn man bei bereits aktivem Folgen erneut das Folgen aktiviert.

	SkuChat:
		Neuerungen
			- SkuChat sammelt jetzt testweise im hintergrund alle Wörter aus dem Chat, für die es noch keine Audiodateien gibt.
			  Ich werde versuchen damit eine Wortdatenbank der häufigsten Wörter aufzubauen, damit wir früher oder später den Chat Ingame vorlesen lassen können.
			  Es wäre daher gut, wenn ihr von Zeit zu Zeit eure Liste mit den fehlenden Wörtern an mich weitergebt.
			  Ihr könnt sie ganz einfach über das Audiomenü abrufen: "SkuOptions > Optionen > Liste mit fehlenden Wörtern". 
			  Dann kopiert ihr die Liste mit STRG + C und fügt den kopierten Text irgendwo für mich ein. In Dicord. Oder in eine Textdatei, die ihr mir schickt. Oder in eine E-Mail and duugu@duugu.com, die ihr mit schickt. Oder wo auch immer.
			  Achtung: bei jedem kopieren der Liste über das Menü wird die Liste geleert!



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
Änderungen in Version 15.2

	SkuNav:
		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- "Route > Route folgen > Ziele Entferung" hat jetzt keine Verzögerung mehr. Auch nicht bei vielen Routen/Wegpunkten.
			  Außerdem werden bei den erreichbaren Zielen keine Autopunkte mehr aufgeführt.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
Änderungen in Version 15.1

	SkuNav:
		Neuerungen
			- Alle Standard-Wegpunkte für Flugmeister und Gastwirte wurden entfernt, da jetzt hinter den NPC-Standardpunkten die Rollen angesagt werden.
			- Wenn NPCs einen Subnamen haben (z. B. "Priesterlehrer"), wird dieser jetzt in allen NPC-Listen mit angezeigt. Gibt es keinen Subnamen, werden mögliche Rollen angezeigt (z. B. "Händler", "Klassenlehrer" etc.).
			- In der Routenerstellung können jetzt Auto-Wegpunkte (automatisch beim Routenaufzeichnen erstellt Zwischenwegpunkte) als Punkt A oder B ausgewählt werden.
			  Dies dient dazu, neue Routen einfacher an das Routennetz anbinden zu können, wenn es bereits Routen mit Zwischenwegpunkten in der Nähe gibt.
			- Bei der Routenaufzeichnungg kann jetzt die linke ALT-Taste gedrückt werden, um zu verhindern, dass neue Routenpunkte bei Kreuzungen mit bestehenden Routen erstellt werden, oder dass bestehende Routenpunkte in der Nähe übernommen werden.
			  Solange die linke ALT-Taste gedrückt ist, passiert beides nicht.
			- Beim erstellen einer neuen Route gibt es jetzt für Punkt B eine neue Option L["Set on completion"].
			  Mit dieser Option legst du den Zielpunkt (seinen Namen für neue Punkte, bzw. den gewünschten bestehenden Wegpunkt) erst am Ziel fest.
			  Wählst du die Option für Punkt B, öffnet sich beim Abschließen der Route über "Route > Aufzeichnung abschließen" ein Untermenü L["Point B"], in dem du nachträglich wie gewohnt den Punkt B definieren oder auswählen muss. Hast du das erledigt, wird die Aufzeichnung abgeschlossen.
			  Hast du Punkt B bereits bei Aufzeichnungsbeginn definiert oder ausgewählt, wir die Aufzeichnung bei "Route > Aufzeichnung abschließen" direkt abgeschlossen - ohne den Untermenüpunkt L["Point B"].
			  Diese neue Funktion L["Set on completion"] für Punkt B ist hilfreich, wenn man vorher nicht genau weiß, wo die Route hingehen soll, oder welche bestehenden Wegpunkte am Ziel vorhanden sind.
			- Die Option mit den aktuellen Koordinaten bei der Benennung neuer Wegpunkte wurde entfernt.
			- Bei jedem Einloggen werden ab sofort alle bestehenden Routen überprüft. Defekte Routen (z. B. mit ungültigen Wegpunkten durch Disconnects, veralteten Wegpunktdaten etc.) werden dabei gelöscht.
			  Auch alle Wegpunkten aus den betroffenen Routen, die nicht von anderen Routen verwendet werden, werden gelöscht.
			  Sollten dabei Routen und Wegpunkte gelöscht worden sein, sagt das Addon dies direkt nach dem Einloggen an.
			- Unter "Route > Verwalten > Löschen" können jetzt alle Routen, alle in der aktuellen Zone und einzelne Routen gelöscht werden.

		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- Weitere Fehler beim Import und Export von Daten wurden behoben.
			- Es wurde ein Fehler beim Abbrechen einer Routenaufzeichnung behoben, bei dem Autopunkte nicht gelöscht wurden.

	SkuOptions:
		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- Ein Problem mit der Audioausgabe, bei der Audioausgaben zu spät, in falscher Reihenfolge oder scheinbar ohne Zusammenhang kamen, wurde (hoffentlich) behoben. (Zum Beispiel "Menü geschlossen" irgendwo mittendrin.)


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
Änderungen in Version 15

	SkuOptions:
		Neuerungen
			- Das Audiomenü sagt jetzt grundsätzlich keine Koordinaten mehr an.

		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- Die Gildenbank ist jetzt über das Lokal-Menü zugreifbar. Allerdings nur Fach eins. Der Zugriff auf Fach zwei steht auf der Todo-Liste.

	SkuChat:
		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- Einen Fehler behoben, durch den bei gleichzeitiger Nutzung des SkuFluegel-Addons der Chat nicht mehr im TTS-Fenster angezeigt wurde.
			- Chat-Nachrichten werden jetzt auch im Kampf erfasst. Es gibt allerdings nach wie vor im Kampf kein Audiosignal bei neuen Nachrichten.
			  Sollten im Kampf neue Nachrichten gekommen sein, gibt es nach dem Kampf ein einziges Audiosignal dafür.

	SkuNav:
		Neuerungen
			- Alle standardmäßigen NPC-Wegpunkte wurden hinter dem Namen des NPCs um seine Rolle(n) erweitert.
			  Aufgrund dieser grundsätzlichen Namensänderung für NPC-Wegpunkte werden mit dieser Version (Sku 15) alle bereits erstellten Routen und Wegpunkte gelöscht!
			  Die folgenden NPC-Rollen werden berücksichtigt/angesagt:
				Questgeber
				Trainer
				Klassentrainer
				Berufstrainer
				Händler
				Munition
				Essen
				Gift
				Reagenzien
				Reparieren
				Flugmeister
				Geistheiler
				Gastwirt
				Banker
				Auktionator
				Stallmeister
			- Unter "SkuNav > Route > Neue Route > Punkt A/B > Aktuelle Karte Entfernung" werden jetzt auch alle Auto-Wegpunkte aufgeführt. 
			   So können neue Routen möglichst nah an das bestehende Netz angebunden werden.
			- Unter "SkuNav > Route > Verwalten" gibt es jetzt Optionen zur Routenverwaltung:
				Löschen: Die ausgewählte Route (Auflistung nach Entfernung; filterbar) und alle nicht in anderen Routen verwendeten benutzerdefinierten Wegpunkte in der Route werden gelöscht.
				Umbenennen (noch nicht implementiert): Die ausgewählte Route umbenennen.
				Bearbeiten (noch nicht implementiert): Die Wegpunkte der ausgewählten Route verändern/bearbeiten.
			- Unter "SkuNav > Wegpunkt > Verwalten" gibt es jetzt Optionen zur Wegpunktverwaltung. Wegpunkte, die in derzeit einer Route verwendet werden, können nicht gelöscht, umbenannt oder geändert werden.
				Löschen (noch nicht implementiert): Den ausgewählten Wegpunkt (Auflistung nach Entfernung; filterbar) löschen.
				Umbenennen (noch nicht implementiert): Den ausgewählte Wegpunkt umbenennen.
				Bearbeiten (noch nicht implementiert): Die Koordinaten des ausgewählten Wegpunkts neu setzen.

	SkuAudiodata:
		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- Es wurde weitere fehlende Audiodateien hinzugefügt.

Änderungen in Version 14.7

	Allgemein:
		Neuerungen
			- Das Addon "BugSack" ist jetzt Teil des Sku-Paketes. Es sammelt Fehlermeldungen, sodass diese nicht mehr im Chat angezeigt werden.
			  Es fügt der Minimap ein Icon mit einem grünen Beutel hinzu. Wenn der Beutel rot wird, hat es einen Fehler abgefangen.
			  Das Addon kann eine Audiomeldung bei einem Fehler ausgeben. Das ist standardmäßig aus. (Siehe unten.)

	SkuOptions:
		Neuerungen
			- Du findest eine neue Option für eine Audiomeldung bei Fehlern unter "SkuOptions > Optionen > Debug Optionen > Sound bei Fehler".
			- Du kannst bei Bedarf den letzten Fehler in einem Fenster anzeigen lassen: "SkuOptions > Optionen > Debug Optionen > Fehler anzeigen".

		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- Den aktuellen Audiotext mit rechter Shift-Taste abbrechen funktioniert jetzt auch für Wegpunkt-Ansagen.

	SkuCore:
		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- Die Opton für Jäger sagt jetzt wirklich alle 15 Sekunden ein nicht glückliches Tier an - und nicht wie bisher versehentlich alle 3 Minuten. :)

	SkuQuest:
		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- Die vielen Plings nach dem ersten Einloggen gibt es nicht mehr.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
Änderungen in Version 14.6

	SkuNav:
		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- Ein weiterer Fehler im Import und Export von Routen wurde behoben. Sie könnten jetzt funktionieren. Es sei denn, Kai finde noch einen übersehenen Fehler. :)
			- Nach dem Import und Export wird jetzt angesagt wir viele Routen/Wegpunkte von wie vielen importiert/exportiert wurden.

	SkuOptions:
		Neuerungen

	SkuCore:
		Fehlerkorrektur
			- Die Funktion zur Ansage der Zufriedenheit des Tiers von Jägern funktioniert jetzt.
			  Sie alle 15 Sekunden "Unzufrieden" bzw. "Zufrieden" an.
			  Ist das Tier "Glücklich" sagt sie nix.

	SkuOptions:
		Neuerungen
			- Es gibt jetzt ein grafisches "Audiomenü".
			  Das grafische Menü zeigt für Sehende parallel zum Audiomenü alle Menüoptionen in einer visuellen Baumstruktur an.
			  Das grafische Menü ist standardmäßig ausgeschaltet.
			  Du muss es in den Blizzard-Interfaceeinstellungen unter "Interface > Addons > Sku-Addons > SkuOptions > Audio Menü visuell" aktivieren.
			  Es geht auf und zu, sobald man das Audiomenü auf und zu macht (mit SHIFT + F1).
			  Alles was im Audiomenü passiert, wird parallel im grafischen Menü durchgeführt, und andersrum.

		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- Das Beenden der aktuellen Audioausgabe wurde von der rechten Steuerungstaste auf rechte Shift-Taste verschoben.
			- Die Optionen zum Routen-Import und -Export für die aktuelle Zone funktionieren jetzt.

	SkuAudiodata:

			- Es wurde weitere fehlende Audiodateien hinzugefügt.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
Änderungen in Version 14.4

	Allgemein:
		- Das Addon "BugGrabber" ist jetzt Teil des Sku-Paketes. Es fängt nervige Fehlermeldungen ab.
		- Weitere fehlende Audiodateien wurden hinzugefügt.

	SkuCore:
		Neuerungen
			- SkuCore hat unter L["Options"] ein neues Untermenü namens "Klassen" bekommen. Darunter befinden sich weitere Untermenüs für die einzelnen Klassen.
			  In diesen Menüs werden zukünfigt klassenbezogene Optionen zur Verfügung stehen.
			  Den Anfang macht der Jäger, für den es jetzt eine Funktion gibt, um anzusagen wenn das Tier Hunger hat. (Standard: Ein)

	SkuNav:
		Neuerungen
			- Es gibt jetzt nicht nur "Import" und "Export", sondern auch "Import Zone" und "Export Zone". Damit werden nur die Wegpunkte und Routen im-/exportiert, die in der aktuellen Zone liegen oder mindestens einen Endpunkt in dieser haben.
			- Die Beacon-Lautstärke kann jetzt in Prozent angepasst werden: "SkuNav > Optionen > Beacon Lautstärke". (Wird nur auf neue Beacons angewendet. Nicht auf schon laufende.)
			- Die Optionen zum Löschen und Umbenennen von Wegpunkten und Routen wurden vorübergehend deaktiviert.
			- Die Entferung zu einem Wegpunkt wird jetzt als "x Uhr y Meter" angesagt, statt nur die beiden zahlen zu sagen. Diese ausführliche Ansage kann unter "SkuNav > Optionen > Ausführliche Richtung und Entfernung" ausgestellt werden. Standardmäßig ist sie an.

		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- Die Optionen zum Entfernen der Standardwegpunkte (Flugmeister, Briefkasten etc.) wurden entfernt.
			- Beim Sterben geht jetzt das aktuelle Beacon aus. Schnellwegpunkt 4 wird beim Geist freilassen auf die Leiche gesetzt. Es geht ein korrektes Beacon für Schnellwegpunkt 4 an.
			- Unter "SkuNav > Routen > Route folgen > Ziele Entfernung" werden jetzt nur noch die 10 nahesten Einstiegspunkte angezeigt.
			- Die starke Verzögerung bei der Auswahl von Metarouten (Routen > Route Folgen > Ziele Entfernung) wurde behoben.
			- Die Routenanzeige auf der Minimap ist jetzt standardmäßig aus.
			- Die Routenanzeige auf der Minimap zeigt jetzt nur noch die Routen auf dem aktuellen Kontinent an.

				40 Grad 40 Meter

	SkuOptions:
		Neuerungen
			- Das geöffnete Handelsfenster ist jetzt über das Lokal-Audiomenü bedienbar.
			- Mit der rechten STRG-Taste kannst du jetzt jede gerade laufende Audioansage abbrechen.
			- Man kann jetzt im Taschenmenü direkt zum vorherigen/nächsten nicht leeren Taschenplatz wechseln, indem man zweimal ganz schnell hintereinander Pfeil runter oder hoch drückt.
			- Die Liste mit den fehlenden Wörtern (Piepser) kann jetzt direkt im Spiel kopiert werden:
			  Du rufst sie unter "SkuOptionen > Optionen > Fehlende Audio Wörter kopieren" auf. Dann einfach STRG + C zum Kopieren in die Zwischenablage drücken, und die kopierte Liste über eine Textdatei, per Discord, per E-Mail (an duugu@duugu.com) oder über einen anderen Weg weiterleiten.

		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- Bei Texten mit Anführungsstrichen (z. B. NPC-Namen) wird jetzt nicht mehr "Backslash" mitgesprochen.
			- Das Neuladen des Interface mit /reload beendet jetzt sämtliche noch laufenden Audioinhalte (Beacons, Menü-Hintergrund etc.)

	SkuQuest:
		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- Die aktuelle Quest mit STRG + SHIFT + T teilen funktioniert jetzt wieder. Zudem wird jetzt angesagt, wenn die Quest nicht teilbar ist.

	SkuMob:
		Neuerungen
			- Das aktuelle Ziel kann angehandelt werden: "SkuMob > Ziel Menü". Dann weiter mit "Lokal > Dropdown Liste 1 > Handeln > Linksklick".

	SkuChat:
		Neuerungen
			- Die Chat-Anzeige kann jetzt mit ESCAPE geschlossen werden.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
Änderungen in Version 14.3

	SkuNav:
		Neuerungen
			- SkuNav kann jetzt automatisch bei einem neuen TomTom-Pfeil ein Audio-Beacon and die entsprechende Stelle setzen.
			  Die Option ist standardmäßig aus. Aktivieren unter "SkuNav > Optionen > Auto Signal bei Tom Tom Pfeil".

		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- Unter "SkuNav > Wegpunkte > Auswählen" werden jetzt bei "Aktuelle Karte und "Aktuelle Karte Entfernung" ebenfalls alle Standardwegpunkte angezeigt (NPCs, Briefkasten, Flugmeister etc.).


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
Änderungen in Version 14.2

	SkuOptions:
		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- Das Abwählen von Wegpunkten ("SkuNav > Wegpunkt > Abwählen") funktioniert jetzt.
			- Das Auswählen von Standardwegpunkten funktioniert jetzt wieder.

	SkuNav:
		Neuerungen
			- Die Option "Routen > Aufzeichnung beenden" heißt zur besseren Verdeutlichung jetzt "Routen > Aufzeichnung abschließen".
			- Es gibt unter Routen jetzt eine Option "Aufzeichnung abbrechen". Mit dieser wird eine laufende Routenaufzeichnung beendet und die gerade aufgezeichnete Route wird gelöscht.

		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- Beim Abschließen der Aufzeichnung einer Route werden jetzt möglicherweise noch laufende Beacons deaktiviert.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
Änderungen in Version 14.1

	SkuChat:
		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- Der Chat funktioniert wieder.

	SkuNav:
		Neuerungen
			- Unter "SkuNav" gibt es jetzt eine Option "Route folgen beenden".
			- Die Tastenkombination für einen neuen Zwischenwegpunkt bei der Aufzeichnung einer Route ist jetzt STRG + SHIFT + P
			- Bei einem Ausgewählten Wegpunkt wird nun mit ALTGr die Richtung (Uhrzeit) und die Entfernung (Meter) angesagt. Erste Zahl Richtung, zweite Zahl Entfernung.
			- Unter "SkuNav > Optionen > Reichweite für nahe Routenstarts" kann jetzt die Entfernung festgelegt werden in der mögliche Einstiegs-Wegpunkte  beim Folgen von Routen über die "Ziele Entfernung"-Funktion berücksichtigt werden. Der Standardwert ist 30 Meter.
			- Die Anzeige der vorhandenen Routen auf der Minimap für Sehende kann jetzt mit STRG + SHIFT + R ein- und ausgeblendet werden.
			- Bei der Routenerstellung werden jetzt wirklich alle Wegpunkte zur Auswahl als bestehender Wegpunkt für Punkt A oder B aufgeführt. Auch alle Standardwegpunkte und alle NPC-Wegpunkte.
			  Bisher waren dort nur die selbst erstellten Wegpunkt aufgeführt. Keine Standardwegpunkte wie Flugmeister, Briefkästen, NPCs etc.
			  Dies betrifft die folgenden Menüoptionen unter "Route > Neue Route > Punkt A/B":
				- Aktuelle Karte
				- Aktuelle Karte Entferung
				- Alle alphabetisch
			- Unter "SkuNav" gibt es jetzt die Option "Daten". Darunter gibt es die Unterpunkte "Import", "Export alle" und "Export aktuelle Karte".
			  Diese Optionen dient dazu, Wegpunkte und Routen an Andere weiterzugeben oder von diesen zu erhalten.
			  Die Verwendung ist quasi selbsterklärend. Der Export erstellt eine lange Zeichenfolge und zeigt diese in WoW in einem Fenster an. Du kopierst sie mit STRG + C.
			  Dann gibst du die Zeichenfolge an jemanden weiter. Dieser wählt den "Import" bei SkuNav, das Addon zeigt ein Fenster an, derjenige fügt die Zeichenfolge mit STRG + V ein, und drückt ENTER. Fertig.
			  Beim Import von Wegpunkten und Routen kann es zu Doubletten kommen!
			  Wegpunkte und Routen haben Namen. Haben unter den importierten Wegpunkten und Routen welche die gleichen Namen wie bestehende, so führt das zu eine Doublette bzw. einem Konflikt.
			  SkuNav löst diese Importkonflikte folgendermaßen auf:
			  - Ist der Wegpunkt bzw. die Route mit dem gleiche Namen mit der zu importierenden identisch (gleiche Koordinaten), so wird der zu importierende einfach ignoriert.
			  - Hat der zu importierende den gleichen Namen, aber andere Daten (z. B. Koordinaten), so wird der zu importierende umbenannt und importiert. Es wird eine laufende Nummer angehängt.

		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- Bei Audio-Beacons nimmt die Lautstärke jetzt mit der Entfernung weniger schnell ab. Die Minimallautstärke wird jetzt erst 3 mal weiter entfernt als zuvor erreicht.
			- Ein Fehler beim Import und Export von Wegpunkt- und Routendaten wurde behoben (SkuNav > Daten).
			  Ich kann keine Importfehler mehr finden. Das heißt nicht, dass keine da sind. Bitte gründlich testen.


	SkuOptions:
		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- Einige vergessen Debug-Ausgaben im Chat wurden entfernt.
			- Wenn eine Liste unter einem Audiomenüpunkt leer war (z. B. "SkuNav > Wegpunkt > Auswählen > Aktuelle Karte", ohne einen vorhanden Wegpunkt in der aktuellen Karte), dann ist das Menü beim öffnen eines solchen leeren Menüpunktes bisher einfach immer zurück zum vorherigen Menüpunkt gesprungen.
			  Das war verwirrend. Ab sofort wird daher unter solchen leeren Menüpunkten stattdessen ein einziger Eintrag namens "Liste leer" angezeigt. Wenn man den Eintrag "Liste leer" auswählt, passiert nichts. 
			  Das Menü bleibt jedoch in dem Menüpunkt und springt nicht einfach kommentarlos zurück.
			- Ab sofort sind immer alle Menüoptionen sichtbar - auch diejenigen, die gerade nicht nutzbar sind. Dies löst das Problem, dass irgendwann beispielsweise die "Route folgen"-Option verschwunden war.
			  Bisher wurden bestimmte Menüoptionen ausgeblendet, wenn sie nicht genutzt werden konnten. Beispiel: Der Menüpunkt "Wegpunkt > Umbenennen" war nicht sichtbar, wenn kein Wegpunkt ausgewählt war.
			  Durch die teilweise ausgeblendeten Menüpunkte wurde das Menü unübersichtlich und der Schnellzugriff wurde gestört.
			  Das Menü kontrolliert jetzt stattdessen bei der Auswahl eines Menüpunktes, ob dieser möglich ist.
			  Beispiel: Auswahl von "Wegpunkt > Neu" bei bereits aktivem Folgen zu einem Wegpunkt. In dem Fall sagt das Menü bei "Neu", dass dies nicht möglich ist und macht nichts.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
Änderungen in Version 14

	SkuOptions:
		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- Bei der Namenenszusammenstellung ist es jetzt in filterbaren Listen nicht mehr möglich einen eingegebenen Filterbegriff mit ENTER als irregulären Namensbestandteil auszuwählen.

		Neuerungen
			- Die Sku-Addons kommunizieren jetzt insgeheim über dunkle Kanäle mit dem zusätzlichen Addon namens "SkuFluegel", dass Fluegelleuten den Status des Geführten anzeigt.
			  Flügelleute können über SkuFluegel folgendes zum Geführten sehen: Folgen, Zaubern, Interagieren (NPCs, Questgeber), Reiten und Looten
			  In den Sku-Addons selbst hat das jedoch keine Auswirkungen.

	SkuChat:
		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- Die Textdarstellung im TTS-Panel für die Texterkennung (NVDA) wurde optimiert.

	SkuNav:
		Neuerungen
			- Die neuen Audio-Beacons wurden intergriert. Jeder Wegpunkt wird jetzt mit einem Beacon markiert.

			- Es gibt jetzt Standardwegpunkte für alle NPCs und Mobs. Diese können überall verwendet werden, wo Wegpunkte (Wegpunkt auswählen, Route erstellen etc.) relevant sind.
			  In der Liste der NPC-Wegpunkte finden sich alle Spawnpunkte pro NPC/Mob.
			  Hat ein NPC oder Mob mehrere Spawnpunkte, so werden in der alphabetischen Liste aller Wegpunkte aus Geschwindigkeitsgründen nur die ersten 3 aufgeführt.

			- Die Routen-Funktion ist jetzt fertig und kann verwendet werden.
			  1. Definition von Routen:
				Eine Route besteht aus Wegpunkten. Es gibt für jede Route mindestens zwei End-Wegpunkte (Punkt A und Punkt B). Dazu kann es beliebig viele Zwischen-Wegpunkte geben.
			  	Auch Routen-Wegpunkte sind ganz normale Wegpunkte, mit Namen und allem drum und dran. Du kannst sie also auch ohne Route normal wie bekannt als Wegpunkt nutzen. Und du kannst auch normale Wegpunkte für Routen nutzen.
				Metarouten sind virtuelle Routen, die aus mehreren echten Routen bestehen. Wenn du beispielsweise von deinem Standpunkt Ziel x über Route 1, dann weiter über Route 2 und dann weiter über Route 3 erreichen kannst, dann ist dieser gesamte Weg eine Metaroute.
			  2. Routen erstellen:
			  	- Beim Erstellen einer Route definierst du vor dem Start der Aufzeichnung die beiden End-Wegpunkte Punkt A und Punkt B der Route, sowie gegebenenfalls die Aufzeichnungsmethode für Zwischen-Wegpunkte (manuell oder automatisch).
			  	  Punkt A und B kannst du im Rahmen der Routendefinition jeweils neu erstellen ("Neu" und dann einen Namen zusammenstellen, wie beim Erstellen von Wegpunkten), oder du kannst bereits bestehende Wegpunkte auswählen.
			  	  Im Rahmen der Routendefinition bzw. Routenaufzeichnung ist Punkt A der Punkt, an dem die Routenaufzeichnung beginnt. Punkt B ist der Punkt, an dem die Routenaufzeichnung endet.
			  	  Erstellst du Punkt A neu, beginnt die Routenaufzeichnung da wo du gerade stehst. Erstellst du Punkt B neu, endet die Routenaufzeichnung da, wo du stehst wenn du die Aufzeichnung beendest.
			  	  Wählst du einen bestehenden Punkt A aus, führt dich das Addon vor dem Beginn der Aufzeichnung über die normalen Richtungs- und Entfernungsangaben für Wegpunkte zum bestehenden Wegpunkt A.
				  Erst, wenn du Punkt A erreicht hast, beginnt die Routenaufzeichnung.
			  	  Wählst du einen bestehenden Punkt B aus, führt dich das Addon ab dem Beginn der Aufzeichnung Richtung Punkt B, bis du Punkt B erreicht hast. 
				  An Punkt B endet die Aufzeichnung dann automatisch.
				  Wenn die Aufzeichnung an Punkt A begonnen hat, werden auf dem Weg zu Punkt B automatisch Zwischenwegpunkte erstellt (wenn du das bei der Routen-Definition vor dem Start ausgwählt hattest).
				  Alternativ kannst an jeder beliebigen Stelle mit STRG + SHIFT + PLUS manuell einen Zwischen-Wegpunkt erstellen.
				- Die Zwischen-Wegpunkte sind intern auch ganz normale Wegpunkte. Sie haben aber keine Namen, sondern heißen alle L["auto"] und werden einfach durchnummeriert. Du kannst auf die Zwischen-Wegpunkt nicht über das Wegpunktmenü zugreifen.
				- Solltest du beim Aufzeichnen eine bestehende Route kreuzen, wird automatisch am Kreuzungspunkt ein Zwischenwegpunkt erstellt.
				- Solltest du dich beim Erstellen (egal ob manuell oder automatisch) eines neuen Zwischenwegpunktes in der Nähe eines bestehenden Routenwegpunktes befinden, wird statt einen neuen Wegpunkt zu erstellen der bestehende Wegpunkt verwendet.
			  3. Routen folgen:
				Du hast unter "Route > Route folgen" mehrere Optionen:
				- Ziele Entferung: 
				  Dieses Menü zeigt dir Metarouten für alle Ziele an, die du über Routenpunkte in deiner Nähe erreichen kannst.
				  Im ersten Untermenü findest du alle Routenpunkte in der Nähe. Mit Entfernungsangabe. Sortiert nach der Entfernung.
				  Unter dem jeweiligen Punkt findest du dann im nächsten Untermenü alle Ziele, die du von dort aus erreichen kannst. Mit der Entfernung zu diesem Ziel.
				  Wählst du eines der Ziele aus, führt dich das Addon über die Metaroute zum Ziel.
				- Alle nach Entferung:
				  Dieses Menü zeigt alle Routen an. Sortiert nach der Entferung zum nahesten ihrer jeweilien Routenpunkte.
				  Du kannst für die Entfernung im nächsten Untermenü nur die Endpunkte (A/B) oder auch alle Zwischenpunkte berücksichtigen.
				  Hast du eine Route ausgewählt, gibt dir das nächste Untermenü alle Routenpunkte der Route an. Du wählst einen aus, bei dem du in die Route einsteigen willst.
				  Hast du den Einstiegspunkt ausgewählt, musst du zum Schluss noch auswählen, in welche Richtung der Route du von diesem Einstiegspunkt folgen möchtes. Richtung A oder B.
				- Endpunkt in Zone:
				  Dieses Menü zeigt alle Routen an, die mindestens einen Endpunkt (A/B) in deiner aktuellen Zone ahben.
				  Hier wählst du nach Auswahl der Route noch aus, von welchem Endpunkt du starten möchtest.
				- Alle alphabetisch:
				  Alle Routen, alphabetisch sortiert.
				  Auch hier wählst du nach Auswahl der Route noch aus, von welchem Endpunkt du starten möchtest.
			  4. Tipps zum Erstellen von Routen:
				- Möglichst keinen neuen Wegpunkte direkt neben einen bestehenden setzen. Stattdessen den bestehenden Wegpunkte nutzen.
				- Möglichst keine parallelen Routen erstellen. Bestehende Routen nutzen, und von diesen Abzweigen. Oder Wegpunkte von bestehenden Routen nutzen.
				- Neue Routen-Endpunkte (A und B) konsistent und sinnvoll benennen.

	SkuCore:
		Neuerungen
			- Es gibt eine neue Funktion, die das durch einen Auto-Nahkampfangriff unterbrochene Folgen nach dem Kampf automatisch wiederaufnimmt.
			  Sie ist standardmäßig AUS. Du findest sie unter "SkuCore > Optionen > Auto folgen".
			  Sie funktioniert nur, wenn du in einer Gruppe bist und einem Gruppenmitglied folgst.
			  Wenn du das Folgen absichtlich unterbrichst (durch Bewegen oder einen Befehl), wird es nicht wiederaufgenommen.

	SkuAudio:
		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- Es wurde weitere gemeldete fehlende Audiodateien hinzugefügt.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
Änderungen in Version 13.1

	SkuChat:
		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- Die mehrfache Chatausgabe ist beseitigt. Sie trat auf, wenn man eine Instanz betreten oder verlassen hat.

	SkuNav:
		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- Wenn man mit ausgewähltem Wegpunkt den Ruhestein oder ein Portal nimmt, gibt es jetzt keinen Fehler mehr.
			- In der Tiefenbahn gibt es jetzt nicht mehr das Dauergeräusch.

	SkuCore:
		Neuerungen
			- Das Würfelfenster ist jetzt testweise Teil des Lokal-Audiomenüs. Bitte ausprobieren.
			  Wenn um einen Gegenstand gewürfelt werden kann, geht das Lokal-Menü auf.
			  Das funktioniert natürlich nur außerhalb des Kampfes. Sollte das Würfelfenster im Kampf geöffnet werden, geht das Menü nach Kampfende auf, falls die Würfelfrist dann noch nicht abelaufen ist.
			- Ab blauen Gegenständen geht beim looten (nicht beim Würfeln) von BoP-Gegenständen ein Fenster auf, mit dem man das Looten bestätigen muss. Dieses Fenster ist jetzt ebenfalls in das Lokal-Menü integriert.

		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- Wenn man bereits auf Folgen ist, und erneut folgen auswählt, sagt Sku jetzt nicht mehr "Folgen beendet" und dann "Folgen", sondern nur noch einmal "Folgen".

	SkuOptions:
		Neuerungen
			- Es gibt jetzt unter "SkuOptions > Optionen > Lokal aktiv" die Möglichkeit das Lokal-Menü für alle Fenster wie Taschen, Char, Händler etc. auszuschalten.
			  Es gibt keine Tastenkombination dafür. Wenn du darauf häufig und schnell zugreifen möchtest, kannst du dir den Menüpunkt auf eine Schnellwahltaste legen (STRG + SHIFT + F9 bis F12 zum festlegen, SHIFT + F9 bis F12 zum aufrufen)


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
Änderungen in Version 13

	Allgemein:
		- Ein paar vergessene Debug-Meldungen wurden entfernt und tauchen jetzt nicht mehr im Chat auf.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
Änderungen in Version 12.3

	SkuOptions:
		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- Bei einem Händler wird jetzt mit ESC im Menü wieder wie vorher das Händler-Fenster und das Taschenfenster geschlossen.
			- Beim manuellen öffnen des Menüs mit SHIFT+F1 kann jetzt auch wieder das (leere) Lokal-Menü ohne Fehler ausgewählt werden.
			- Der Hintergrundsound im Menü ändert sich jetzt wieder direkt nach der Auswahl eines Sounds statt erst beim nächsten Öffnen.

	SkuMob:
		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- Das Kontextmenü für das Ziel ("SkuMob > Ziel Menü") bleibt jetzt auf bis was ausgewählt oder das Menü geschlossen wird. Questie wurde gemaßregelt und macht das jetzt nicht mehr kaputt.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
Änderungen in Version 12.2

	SkuOptions:
		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- Einen Fehler mit dem Händer-Fenster beseitigt.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
Änderungen in Version 12.1

	SkuOptions:

			- Fehler mit dauerhaften Geräuschen in Instanzen beseitigt.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
Änderungen in Version 12

		Neuerungen
			- Diverse Char-Namen sind jetzt als Audiodaten vorhanden und sollten angesagt werden.

	SkuOptions:
		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- Bei ESCAPE wird jetzt beim Öffnen des Spielmenüs wieder der bekannte Sound gemacht.
			- Im Audiomenü wird jetzt beim Wechseln von Menüoptionen immer derselbe "Zisch"-Sound gemacht. Kein "Klack" mehr bei "Auswählen".

		Änderungen
			- Das Audiomenü kann nun beim Folgen und Auto-Laufen geöffnet werden. Nur, wenn eine Bewegung über die WASD- oder Pfeiltasten stattfindet, bleibt das Menü geschlossen.
		
		Neuerungen
			- Das Audiomenü kann im geöffneten Zustand mit einem leisen Hintergrundsound unterlegt werden. 
			  Der Sound ist unter "SkuOptions > Optionen > Hintergrund Audio" auswählbar.
			  Die Voreinstellung ist "Nichts". Ich persönlich mag "Walgesang". :D

	SkuMob:
		Neuerungen
			- Im Menü "SkuMob" gibt es jetzt eine neue Unteroption namens "Ziel Menü". Diese öffnet bei einem ausgewählten Ziel das Kontextmenü für das Ziel.
			  Bei Auswahl der "Ziel Menü"-Funktion geht das Lokal-Menü mit den entsprechenden Optionen wie Betrachten, Einladen, Handeln, Flüstern etc auf (Dropdown Liste 1).


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
Änderungen in Version 11.2
	SkuNav:
		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- Beim Erreichen eines Wegpunktes gab es einen Fehler. Das ist behoben. Echt jetzt. Wirklich. Isch schwör. :)


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
Änderungen in Version 11.1
	Allgemein:
		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- Eine übersehende Debug-Meldung im Chat wurde entfernt ("OnAction Generic ...").

	SkuQuest:
		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- Wenn das offene Questlog mit ESCAPE statt mit L geschlossen wurde, konnte man beim nächsten Öffnen nicht mehr zwischen den Quest wechseln. Das ist jetzt behoben.

	SkuNav:
		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- In bestimten Bereichen in Hauptstädten konnte keine Wegpunkte erstellt werden und das Questlog hat Fehler produziert (durch unvollständige Questie-Daten). Das ist behoben.
			- Beim Erreichen eines Wegpunktes gab es einen Fehler. Das ist behoben.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
Änderungen in Version 11
	Allgemein:
		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- In Instanzen gibt es jetzt keine Fehlermeldungen mehr. Trotzdem funktionieren natürlich auch weiterhin keine Navi-Funktionen. Auch die Feststecken-Anzeige funktioniert natürlich nicht. (Pauschal funktioniert alles nicht, was auf Koordinaten basiert.)

	SkuNav:
		Änderungen
			- Das Menü "Alle" beim Zusammenbauen von Namen (z. B. "SkuNav > Wegpunkt > Neu") heißt jetzt "Alle alphabetisch" und ist alphabetisch sortiert. Es befinde sich jetzt außerdem in der Liste über den einzelnen Glossar-Untermenüs, statt darunter.
			- Im Glossar beim beim Zusammenbauen von Namen gibt es jetzt einen Untermenüpunkt "Zahlen" mit den Wörtern "Eins" bis "Zehn".
			
		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- Folgende Probleme bei "SkuNav > Wegpunkt > Auswählen > Letzte" behoben:
			  - Es gab einen Fehler, wenn noch keine zuletzt ausgewählten Wegpunkte in der Liste sind. "Letzte" wir jetzt nur noch angezeigt, wenn zuvor schon mal Wegpunkte ausgewählt wurden.
			  - War ein Wegpunkt beim Auswählen schon in der "Letzte" Liste, wurde er erneut eingefügt. Jetzt ist jeder Wegpunkt nur noch einmal in der Liste.
			  - Automatisch generierte Wegpunkte aus Routen wurden in der "Letzte"-Liste angezeigt. Das ist jetzt nicht mehr so.
			- Die Liste der Wegpunkte unter "SkuNav > Wegpunkt > Auswählen > Alle alphabetisch" ist jetzt tatsächlich alphabetisch sortiert. :)

	SkuOptions:
		Änderungen
			- Das Spielmenü (ESC) ist jetzt nicht mehr in das Audiomenü eingebunden.

		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- Das & Zeichen sollte jetzt korrekt vorgelesen werden.
			- Beim Öffnen des Lokal-Menüs wird jetzt nicht mehr das Geräusch von ins Ziel nehmen abgespielt.
			- Die Tooltipanzeige bei Buttons im Lokal-Menü (SHIFT + Pfeil runter) geht jetzt korrekt zu, sobald SHIFT losgelassen wird.
			- Wenn bei offenem Menü (z. B. Tasche) ein Popup-Fenster aufgeht (z. B. Anlegen Ja/Nein bei BoE-Gegenständen), springt das Menü nun zum Popup-Fenster.
			- Wenn das "Lokal"-Menü geöffnet wird, unterdrückt das Addon jetzt wie beabsichtigt kurz alle Anderen Sounds (z. B. was ein Händler beim Anklicken sagt.) Dies dient dazu, dass das Audiomenü besser zu verstehen ist, und nicht von der NPC-Begrüßung übertönt wird.
			- Über die Schnellzugriffstasten bzw. über den Slash-Befehl "Short" wurde zwar das Menü geöffnet, aber es hat nicht funktionert. Das ist behoben.

	SkuQuest:
		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- Der Goldbetrag bei Questbelohnungen wird jetzt korrekt angezeigt.
			- Feste Questbelohnungen sollten jetzt angezeigt werden.

	SkuCore: 
		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- Das Audiomenü sagt bei leeren Taschenplätzen keine alte Anzahl mehr an.

		Änderungen
			- Das Audiomenü sagt jetzt bei Taschenplätzen die Nummer des Taschenplatzes an. Beispiel "Button: 5 Gegenstandsname" bei Taschenplatz 5.
			- Durch die Nummerierung der Taschenplätze ist es jetzt möglich Untermenü einer Tasche mit den Tasten 1-9 direkt zum entsprechenden Taschenplatz zu springen.
			- Das Audiomenü sagt jetzt bei Taschenplätzen und Händlern die Anzahl der Gegenstände am entsprechenden Platz hinter dem Gegenstandsnamen an (statt wie bisher vor dem Gegenstandsnamen).


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
Änderungen in Version 10
	Allgemein:
		Änderungen
			- Alle Audioausgaben wurden mit einer neuen und besseren Stimme aufgenommen.
			- Alle Audioausgaben werden nun aus einzelnen Wörtern zusammengebaut. Das sorgt für eine etwas unnatürlichere Wiedergabe,
			  aber auch gleichzeitig für enorme Flexibilität und Möglichkeiten bei den Audioausgaben.
			  Die Pause zwischen den Wörtern kann eingestellt werden (unter "SkuOptions > Optionen > Audio Dauer Pause")
			- Bei jedem Wort ohne Audiodatei gibt es jetzt einen Beep-Ton. Außerdem wird das Wort intern gespeichert.
			  Das dient dazu, die fehlenden Wörter später hinzufügen zu können.
			- Alle Einstellungen bzw. Daten (dazu zählen auch alle bereits angelegten Wegpunkte) aus den älteren Versionen sind mit Version 10 zurückgesetzt bzw. gelöscht.
			- Die Schrift im TTS-Panel (z. B. beim Questlog, bei Dialogen oder im Chat) ist jetzt kleiner, damit mehr Text auf den Bildschirm passt.
			  (Schriftgröße von 25 Punkt auf 18 Punkt verkleinert)

		Neuerungen
			- Es ist ein neues Sku-Addon hinzugekommen: SkuOptions
			  Es ist dafür zuständig das Audiomenü sowie alle Einstellungen/Optionen aller Sku-Addons zentral zusammenzuführen.
			  Wenn man das Audiomenü mit SHIFT + F1 aufruft, gibt es jetzt erstmal 5 Untermenüs namens "SkuNav", "SkuMob" usw.
			  In diesen Untermenüs findet man dann die Menüs für die einzelnen Addons. Die Wegpunkte vom Navi finden sich jetzt also z. B. in der zweiten Ebene unter "SkuNav > Wegpunkte".
			  Alle über das Audiomenü erreichbaren Optionen sind jetzt zusätzlich für Sehende über das Blizzard-Interace-Menü erreichbar (ESC > Interface > Addons > Sku-Addons).
			- Alle Anzeigen im TTS-Panel (z. B. Quests und Dialoge) können jetzt im Spiel vom Addon vorgelesen werden.
			  Es wird immer eine Zeile vorgelesen. Wenn das TTS-Panel offen ist und Text anzeigt, kannst du den folgenden Tasten zur nächsten/vorherigen Zeile springen:
			  	Zur nächsten Zeile: SHIFT + PFEIL RUNTER
			  	Zur vorherigen Zeile: SHIFT + PFEIL HOCH
			  Außerdem sind alle Inhalte im TTS-Panel intern in "Abschnitte" zusammengefasst. Abschnitte sind zusammenhängende Blöcke aus mehreren der Zeilen.
			  Bei einer Quest gibt zum Beispiel die Abschnittte "Questtitel", "Ziele", "Belohnungen" und "Beschreibung".
			  Statt mit SHIFT + PFEIL RUNTER/HOCH immer nur eine Zeile weiter zu springen, kannst du mit den folgenden Tasten direkt einen ganzen Abschnitt weiter springen:
			  	Zum nächsten Abschnitt: STRG + SHIFT + PFEIL RUNTER
			  	Zum vorherigen Abschnitt: STRG + SHIFT + PFEIL HOCH
			  Wenn du also z. B. ganz oben bist, und schnell zu ersten Zeile der Beschreibung ganz unten willst, dann drückst du nicht x mal eine Zeile weiter, sondern nur dreimal einen Abschnitt weiter. Das geht viel schneller.
			- Neuer Audio-Kanal: Bisher wurden alle Sku-Sounds über den Wow-Kanal "Dialog" abgespielt. 
			  Jetzt werden alle Sounds über einen neuen Audio-Kanal namens "Sku" abgespielt. 
			- Audiobegrüßungen bei NPCs werden jetzt unterdrückt, damit das Audiomenü zu verstehen ist.
			- Am oberen Bildschirmrand gibt es jetzt einen einzeiligen schwarzen Balken, in dem der aktuelle Menüpunkt als Text angezeigt wird.

	SkuOptions:
		Änderungen
			- Das Audiomenü wird jetzt bei Kampfbeginn automatisch geschlossen.
			- Das Audiomenü wird jetzt erst bei Kampfende oder Bewegungsende geöffnet, falls das Öffnen im Kampf oder in der Bewegung angefordert wurde.
			- Bei Optionen im Audiomenü ist jetzt automatisch der aktuell eingestellte Wert einer Option vorausgewählt.

		Neuerungen
			- Im Audiomenü unter "SkuOptions > Optionen > Audio-Kanäle" gibt es jetzt Einstellungen für die Lautstärke der einzelnen Audio-Kanäle
			  (Sound, Musik, Umgebung, Dialog) sowie für die Gesamtlautstärke.
			- Unter "SkuOptions > Optionen > Audio-Kanäle > Sku Kanal" kann die Audioausgabe der Sku-Addons auf einen anderen Kanal gelegt werden.
			  (Standard ist der neue "Sku"-Kanal.)
			- Die Sprechgeschwindigkeit, also die Sprachpausen zwischen den einzelnen Wörtern, kann im Audiomenü geändert werden.
			  Menüpunkt: "SkuOptions > Optionen > Audio Dauer Pause"
			  Der Wert geht von 1 bis 100 (das ist der Prozentwert für die Länge der Pause).
			  Der Standardwert ist 75.
			- Das Audiomenü unterstützt jetzt Slash-Befehle. Der Slash-Befehl lautet: /sku
			  Jeder beliebige Menüpunkt kann über den Slash-Befehl "/sku short" aufgerufen werden.
			  Hinter "/sku short " wird einfach der komplette Menüpfad mit Kommas getrennt angegeben.
			  Wird ein Menüpunkt mit weiteren Untermenüs aufgerufen (z. B. "SkuNav > Wegpunkt > Neu"), so wird das Audiomenü mit dem 
			  entsprechenden Menüpfad ausgewählt geöffnet. Du kannst dann direkt dort im Menü weiterarbeiten.
			  Wird ein Menüpunkt ohne weitere Untermenüs aufgerufen (z. B. "SkuNav > Wegpunkt > Abwählen"), so wird der Menüpunkt 
			  direkt ausgeführt, ohne das Audiomenü zu öffnen.
			  Beispiele für Menü-Slash-Befehle: 
			    /sku short,skunav,wegpunkt,neu
			    /sku short,skunav,wegpunkt,auswählen,aktuelle karte,schnellwegpunkt;1
			- Das Audiomenü hat jetzt 4 frei belegbare Schnellwahlziele. Diese führen direkt zu einem bestimmten Menüpunkt.
			  Die Schnellwahlziele werden mit SHIFT + F9 bis F12 aufgerufen. Sie funktionieren exakt so wie der oben beschriebene Slash-Befehl "/sku short".
			  Vorbelegt sind die folgenden Schnellwahlziele:
				SHIFT + F9: SkuNav > Wegpunkt > Auswählen
				SHIFT + F10: SkuNav > Wegpunkt > Abwählen
				SHIFT + F11: SkuNav > Wegpunkt > Neu
				SHIFT + F12: SkuNav > Route				  
			  Die vordefinierten Schnellwahlziele lassen sich mit STRG + SHIFT + F9 bis F12 beliebig neu belegen. 
			  Dazu öffnest du das Menü, gehst du dem Menüpunkt, den du für die Schnellwahl verwenden möchtest, und drückst dann STRG + SHIFT + F9 bis F12
			  Dann wird das entsprechende Schnellwahlziel mit dem aktuellen Menüpunkt verknüpft.

	SkuNav: 
		Neuerungen:
			- Unter "Wegpunkt > Auswählen" wird jetzt als erstes Untermenü "Letzte" angezeigt. 
			  Es enthält die letzten 10 ausgewählten Wegpunkte (von neu nach alt).
			- Beim Zusammenbauen von Namen ("Wegpunkt > Neu" oder Umbenennen) gibt es jetzt ein Untermenü "Alle". In diesem finden sich alle Wörter 
			  aus dem Glossar. Es ist filterbar.
			- Mit SHIFT + M kann jetzt die Minimap vergrößert werden. Erneutes SHIFT + M macht sie wieder klein.

		Änderungen
			- Der Welt-Kompass wird jetzt als Himmelsrichtung in einer männlichen Stimme angesagt.
			- Die Schnellwegpunkte werden jetzt nicht mehr im Menü angezeigt (können also auch nicht mehr umbenannt oder gelöscht werden).
			- Die Schnellwegpunkte werden jetzt nicht mehr beim ausloggen gespeichert.

		Fehlerkorrekturen
			- Auch wenn es niemand gemerkt hat - die Standardwegpunkte in Westfall waren kaputt und funktionieren jetzt. :)
			
	SkuQuest: 
		Neuerungen:
			- Die aktuelle Quest im geöffneten Questlog kann jetzt mit STRG + SHIFT + T geteilt werden.
			  Die Rückmeldung, ob das Teilen geklappt hat, steht im Chat. Also bitte danach ggf. mit SHIFT + F2 nachsehen.
			- Wie oben beschrieben werden die Questinfos im TTS-Panel nun vorgelesen.

	SkuCore: 
		Neuerungen:
			- Folgende Spielerzustände werden jetzt von der männlichen Stimme angesagt:
			  Drinnen, Draußen, Verstohlenheit, Geist, Tot, Schwimmen, Tauchen, Reiten, Reiten beendet, Fallen (ab 1 Sekunde Falldauer), 
			  Laufen, Gehen, Folgen, Folgen beendet, Rasten, AFK		

			- Inhalte von vielen Fenster sind im Audiomenü verfügbar:
			  Ab sofort werden die auswählbaren Optionen in allen wichtigen Fenstern und Dialogfenstern wiedergegeben und können genutzt werden.
			  Zurzeit gilt das für die folgenden Fenster:
			  Flugmeister
			  Questgeber
			  Händler
			  Gastwirte
			  Bänker
			  Trainer
			  Taschen
			  Char-Fenster
			  Talentfenster
			  Stall-Fenster
			  Spielmenü (ESC)
			  Alle Pop-up-Fenster (z. B. "Wiederbeleben"-Fenster, "Port annehmen"-Fenster etc.)

			  Sobald eines oder mehrere der betreffenden Fenster/Dialoge geöffnet ist, geht das Audiomenü auf.
			  Es springt automatisch zu einem neuen ad-hoc Untermenü namens "Lokal".
			  In "Lokal" werden in erster Ebene alle offenen bedienbaren Fenster aufgeführt. Darunter finden sich dann jeweils als Untermenüs alle Texte und Bedienelemente aus dem jeweiligen Fenster.
			  (Das Audiomenü geht dabei mit einer ganz kleinen Verzögerung von 0,65 Sekunden auf. Das lässt sich intern nicht vermeiden.)
			  
			  Das Audiomenü bildet das jeweilige Fenster automatisch 1:1 so ab, wie es in der Benutzeroberfläche vorhanden ist. Dazu liest es intern die einzelnen Bedienelemente aus.
			  Die Bedienelemente in den Fenster der Benutzeroberfläche sind nicht immer hundertprozentig logisch angeordnet. Außerdem haben sind intern nicht allen Namen bzw. Titel zugewiesen.
			  Daher kann die Reihenfolge der Elemente im Audiomenü teilweise etwas ungewöhnlich sein. So kann beispielsweise der "Schließen" Button eines Fensters zuerst erscheinen, obwohl der im echten Fenster ganz unten ist.
			  Die Fensterelemente mit fehlenden Namen werden im Audiomenü durch generische Bezeichnungen wie "Fensterbereich", "Unterbereich" oder "Container X" ersetzt.
			  Durch die Inhalte der Audiomenüs musst du dich durchfuchsen und lernen, was beim jeweiligen Dialog wo zu finden ist. Dazu ist bei den ersten Schritte sicher die Hilfe eines Sehenden sinnvoll, wenn du die tatsächlichen Fenster nicht wirklich kennst bzw. auswendig kennst.

			  Die Audiomenüinhalte haben drei Typen: Untermenüs, Text und Buttons. Wenn es sich um einen Text oder Button handelt, steht das vor dem jeweiligen Menüelement.

			  Text-Menüelemente werden auf 40 Zeichen gekürzt. Sollte der echte entsprechende Text aus der Benutzeroberfläche länger sein, endet der Menüeintrag auf "...".
			  Du kannst dir den restlichen Text über das TTS-Panel anzeigen lassen. Genau wie beim Questfenster. Dazu drückst du mit dem ausgewählten Menüpunkt SHIFT + Pfeil Hoch bzw. SHIFT + Pfeil runter. Dann geht das TTS-Panel auf, und zeigt den Kompletttext. Du kannst dann mit SHIFT + Pfeil runter/hoch die einzelnen Zeilen vorlesen lassen.
			  Springst du zum nächsten Audiomenüpunkt, oder lässt du SHIFT los, geht das TTS-Panel zu.
			  
			  Button-Menüelemente sind alle Schaltflächen, Gegenstände, Zauber etc. im entsprechenden Fenster in der Benutzeroberfläche. Sie enthalten ebenfalls häufig mehr Text. Zum Beispiel den gesamten Tooltiptext, falls es sich um einen Gegenstand handelt. Auch dann drückst du einfach wie oben mit dem ausgewählten Menüpunkt SHIFT + Pfeil Hoch bzw. SHIFT + Pfeil runter, um dir den Tooltip anzeigen zu lassen.
			  Button-Menüelemente enthalten jeweils zwei Unterelemente namens "Linksklick" und "Rechtsklick". (Text hat die nicht, da es da nix zu klicken gibt.)
			  Indem du eines der beiden Unterelemente eines Buttons auswählst, führst du einen Klick in der Benutzeroberfläche aus.
			  Klickst du beispielsweise mit rechts auf einen Gegenstand in der Liste eines Händlers, wird dieses gekauft und landet in deiner Tasche.
			  Klickst du mit links auf einen Gegenstand in deiner Tasche, wird dieser aus der Tasche genommen und an den Mauszeiger geheftet. Klickst du dann erneut mit links auf einen anderen, freien Taschenplatz, wird der Gegenstand am Mauszeiger dort abgelegt.
			  Sobald sich etwas am Mauszeiger befindet (also etwas aufgenommen wurde), wird dies mit dem Gegenstandsnamen angesagt. 

		Änderungen
			- Die Feststecken-Meldung sollte jetzt auch im Brachland korrekt funktionieren. 
			  Zudem berücksichtigt sie langsamere Geschwindigkeiten wie bei Schwimmen, Verstohlenheit etc.

	SkuMob: 
		Neuerungen:
			- Hinter dem Level wird jetzt "Weltboss", "Rare Elite", "Elite" oder "Elite" angesagt, falls eines davon auf das Ziel zutrifft.

Die Tonhöhe zeigt an, wie stark du dich noch bewegst. Ein ganz hoher Piep heisst fast gar nicht mehr (du steckst irgendwo komplett fest).

			- Das Navi sagt jetzt bei jedem Wechsel einer Zone oder Unterzone den Zonennamen an. (Kann man ausstellen unter "Optionen > Zonennamen ansagen".)
			- Es gibt jetzt 3 Schnellwegpunkte zur kurzfristigen Navigation. Diese haben feste Namen ("Schnellwegpunkt 1-3"). 
			Sie dienen zur kurzfristigen ad-hoc Navigation. Mit STRG+SHIFT+F5 (1), STRG+SHIFT+F6 (2) und STRG+SHIFT+F7 (3) wird der jeweilige Schnellwegpunkt auf die aktuellen Koordinaten festgelegt. 
			Mit SHIFT+F5 bis F7 wird der jeweilige Schnellwegpunkt ausgewählt.

			- Auf der jeweils untersten Menüebene (z. B. "Wegpunkt > Auswählen > Aktuelle Karte > " kann man nun die Liste der Auswahlmöglichkeiten filtern. 
				Wenn du ein Wort (bzw. mindestens 2 Buchstaben) eingibst, kommst du in den Filtermodus. Dann wird die Liste der Auswahlmöglichkeiten nach diesem Wort gefiltert.
				Gibst du im Filtermodus weitere Buchstaben ein, werden die zum Filterbegriff hinzugefügt.
				Beispiel: 
					- Du gibst in einem Untermenü "du" ein. Du landest im Filtermodus. Der Filterbegriff lautet "du".
					- Du gibst im Filtermodus "ro" ein. Der Filterbegriff lautet "duro".
					- Du gibst immer noch im Filtermodus "tar" ein. Der Filterbegriff lautet "durotar".
				Du verlässt den Filtermodus mit Backspace/Rückschritt. Dann wird der Filterbegriff gelöscht und die ungefilterte Liste wird angezeigt.
				Sollte dein Filterbegriff keine Treffer ergeben, wird nur noch das erste Element der Liste angezeigt.
		Wegpunkt
			Erstellen
				- Erstellte Wegpunkte werden jetzt im aktuell ausgewählten Profil gespeichert.

				- Das Menü "Wegpunkt > Auswählen" enthält jetzt Untermenüs:
					- Aktuelle Karte: Enthält eine unsortierte Liste alle Wegpunkte in der Karte, in der man sich gerade befindet (z. B. Durotar).
					- Aktuelle Karte Entfernung: Enthält alle Wegpunkte in Karte (z. B. Durotar), in der man sich gerade befindet, sortiert nach deren Entfernung zum Spieler (von nah nach fern).
					- Alle alphabetisch: Enthält alle Wegpunkte aus allen Karten in alphabetischer Sortierung.

						Die Namen der Standardwegpunkte für Karten sind nach dem Schema "Kontinent > Karte > Zone > Unterzone" aufgebaut. Auch bei diesen steht ein s für "Standard" davor.
			Abwählen
				- Damit wird einfach der aktuell ausgewählte Wegpunkt abgewählt.
			Koordinaten aktualisieren
				- Damit werden die Koordinaten des im Moment ausgewählten Wegpunkts mit den Koordination des Spielers aktualisiert. Es gibt zwei Untermenüs:
				- Aktuelle Position: Der ausgewählte Wegpunkt bekommt deine momentanen Koordinaten
				- Koordinaten eingeben: Damit kannst du eine Karte und x und y Koordinaten für die Position des Wegpunktes festlegen. Dazu gibt es die Untermenüs "Karte", "X" und "Y". 
					Du musst aus allen drei Menüs einen Wert auswählen, damit die Koordinaten des Wegpunkts neu festgelegt werden. Welche der drei Werte noch fehlen wird angesagt. 
					Die X und Y Untermenüs enthalten alle möglichen Koordinaten von 0 bis 100 in Schritten von 0,1. Da sind also jeweils 1000 Einträge in der Liste (0,1, 0,2, 0,3 und so weiter).
					Du kannst jedoch in allen drei Untermenüs filtern. Auch in X und Y.
					Wenn du z. B. in "X" eine Zahl mit mindestens zwei Stellen eingibst, wird nach dieser Zahl gefiltert. 
					Beispiel: Gibst du 53 ein, so zeigt das Menü nur noch Zahlen an, die vor dem Komma eine 53 enthalten. Also 53,0, 53,1 53,2 und so weiter bis 53,9.
					Sobald du alle drei Werte (Karte, X und Y) ausgewählt hast, werden die neuen Koordinaten im aktuellen Wegpunkt gespeichert. Verlässt du das "Koordinaten eingeben"-Menü vorher, wird nix gespeichert.
